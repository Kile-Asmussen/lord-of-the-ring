Raziel has the mad harem props
And Zeke is kind of like 'more power to you, bud'
And they have a conversation
Wherein Zeke is like "Look, I appreciate you wanna be Elden Lord, but like, what do you wanna do with that?"
"Rule justly and righeously."
"And like, chimera and hillfolk and omens and albinaurics and the Nox?"
"They will have their place."
"And that place is?"
"Well, they need to be governed and guided to do good."
"And the ones that don't?"
"Why do you care so much?"
"Because it's not on accident my entire party is made of undesirables, while yours is made entirely of noblewomen--- look, we're both from Ishe."
"And?"
"When I was a young girl, my father took me into the city to see a procession of the duke's men. He asked me, daughter mine, when you grow up, will you fight for the downtrodden? I was too young to know what that meant. But now I have sworn to do so."
"Certainly a noble goal."
"And I am Empyrean. So, sorry to say, I'm not going to let you waltz in and bring Marika back, just so you can wear a crown."
