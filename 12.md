Roðrika is as startled and wary as you remember being, but she takes it with the upright composure of a noblewoman. It is the same as it was two weeks ago, though perhaps there's a few less despondent withered Tarnished sitting about.

Dee is nowhere to be seen, neither is Corhyn, but there's new faces --- or at least ones you haven't seen before --- standing across the great big table that gives the Hold its name.

A dark-haired man in ornate polished armor, with a woman in a mail shirt, carrying shield, rapier, and halberd. The man is conversing with Gideon, who glances your way, but is trapped by social convention.

The woman looks over at you as well, with the discerning eye of a fighter, sizing you and your retinue up.

Titania pats you on the back. "Boc, let's just run down to Hewg; I think your armor needs re-fitting."

Boc looks down himself. "I suppose I have put on a few inches, haven't I?"

He hops up on the table to cross it, while Titania walks around it on long steps, leaving you alone with Roðrika.

"What is this place?" she asks.

"This is the Roundtable Hold," you explain. "A haven for Tarnished like you or I." You point to the rune suspended under the ceiling. "That is a rune of power, it makes it so no blood can be spilt in these halls; so you are quite safe. Though --- there's a woman who roams these halls who has some way of circumventing it. Her name is Fia. Do not accept her embrace or invitation to her bed."

"I see," Roðrika says. "And those three over there?"

"Man in the strange armor is Gideon Ofnir, closest thing we have to a proprietor. His domain is the library over yonder. He knows a lot of things, but is impolite --- at least to me. The other two, I don't know."

"And all these people?" Roðrika looks about at the many emaciated Tarnished.

"Lost souls. That big door to the north is locked. Behind us is the banquet hall."

Roðrika turns to look at the open doors, through which is the long table and the elaborate chandelier suspended above.

"There's also kitchens and utilities, but nobody to cook. You've already noticed, but hunger isn't deadly here in the lands between. You will also not grow sick with common disease."

Roðrika nods slowly, then looks at you. "Perhaps one day you could cook a banquet?" She smiles.

You blush. "I can't say the thought never occurred to me."

"What's through that door, then, where Nameless and Boc went?" Roðrika asks and points to the southeast.

"The forge. Master Hewg works there. He will see to any arms and armor you might need."

"Hopefully not much. And the last one?"

"If you need privacy and rest, there's an entire wing of living quarters and bedchambers that way; also rooms with piles of clothing and stacks of furniture, whatever you might need. But that is also the halls Fia stalks. Be wary."

Roðrika hugs herself. "I do feel a bit wary knowing there's a witch here so fierce even you're afraid of her."

You shrug. "She only has the power over you that you give her."

"Still. I would feel safer with an escort. I would like to secure a room for myself, here. Maybe stay a while."

Offering her an arm, she takes it, and you proceed into the domicile wing. Down the hall and up the stairs to the nicer bedchambers.

There you come across Fia, hauling a withered corpse along.

"Fia," you say coldly.

"Jester."

"This woman here, Lady Roðrika, is under my protection. If you touch her, I will touch you."

You see her face contort in contempt under her cowl. "I and not some base whore who accepts all comers," she says, and heads past you to the stairs.

"What?" Roðrika asks. "What did you mean by 'touch her' as a threat?"

"For some reason, if I touch her, she becomes badly burned."

Roðrika holds tighter onto your arm. "That was a corpse."

"It was. She preys on the lost souls. Don't end up like them." You continue down the hall to the room you once entertained Nepheli in.

"How would I go about that?"

"Find something to occupy yourself with. Perhaps Gideon needs another assistant, or Hewg has work for you. Or you could clean up the kitchens. Any number of things to do, here."

She snorts. "A noblewoman working as a scullery maid?"

You open the door to the small bedroom. There's charcoal in the box by the fireplace, and the bed is made --- just like you left it two months ago, if a little dustier. You toss a shovelful of coals in, and light a lively fire with a fingersnap.

"Any extra clothing you need you can just take from the room down the hall. Fia fills it with the possessions of her victims. Laundry you'll have to do yourself---"

The door closes.

"Jester, you've been so kind to me," Roðrika says. You stand and turn to her; she approaches you hands folded over her chest. She comes close enough that you can make out the strands of her blonde hair, and pulls back her red hood.

"I owe you far more than I can repay; such a good and kind soul you have." She reaches out with a soft hand and caresses your cheek. Then she stands on her toes to lean in and kiss you on your cheek."

But she doesn't pull back; instead she whispers in your ear: "_but you can stay the night if you wish._"

You put a hand on her shoulder, and as she steps back, you see confusion in her face.

"Oh, I beg pardon, was that too forward? I just assumed from the way you looked at me and your companions giving us privacy that---"

"Milady, Roðrika," you begin. "Not that I'm not tempted, you are a lovely and fair woman, but I fear you have the wrong idea."

She smiles. Confusion turns to disappointment. Truth is you'd rather not disappoint her, but you are too scrupulous to lead her on under false pretenses.

"If you're looking to offer yourself as a reward for me saving you, I must decline on principle. If you are looking to win my heart, I must disappoint once more; already have a lover."

"Ah," she says, looking down and away. "Naturally, a woman as fine as you should already have a suitor."

You put aside your helmet and toss your gauntlets in it. "Well, it's more that I don't want you to expect to win my heart, I'd absolutely love to share your bed--- actually let me just--- Melina, got a second?" you call into the room.

A moment passes, then ash swirls from the fireplace and forms Melina in her cloak and dress, one eye golden, the other closed with the strange mark over the lid. "... Jester," she says. "Hello again, Lady Roðrika."

She looks from you to Melina and then back.

"You really ought to tell pretty women your real name afore you take them to bed, don't you think?" Melina says.

Roðrika's disappointment has turned back into confusion. "Wait--- so you're together, but..."

"I'm rather less corporeal than is needed to sate Ezekiel's needs," Melina continues. "So I lay no claim to her bed; only her heart. Also, I like to watch."

Now Roðrika blushes. "Oh. _Oh._ Well, I---" She looks at you.

You shrug your shoulders. "That's the terms."

She chews on her cheek for a moment. "Pardon my earlier attempt at seduction."

"Pardon granted," You say.

Melina crosses the floor in a gliding motion, coming up to thr two of you. With a delicate, scarred hand, she takes Roðrika's chin, and turns her head side to side as if inspecting a ware for sale. Then she nods and looks at you. "She's more delicate than the lady warrior from the badlands you bedded two months ago. Take care not to break her."

Then she looks Roðrika in the eye. Blows her a kiss, and vanishes into ash.

Roðrika looks at where Melina just stood for a long moment, then at you, clearly flustered. "I--- I wasn't actually looking for anything other than some female company, I'm not looking for anything long term, not that it wouldn't be nice but just out of practicality; it's just been a long while since--- well all the way before I set out for the lands between, and I don't know if you know how it gets..."

You smile while she rambles, unsligning your sword and shield, unclasping your plate and tossing it aside, then pull your gambeson over your head, leaving you in shirt sleeves and chausses.

"_Oh dear,_" Roðrika mutters, as you step up to her.
