# Flowers and Storms

Roðrika is as startled and wary as you remember being, but she takes it with the upright composure of a noblewoman. It is the same as it was two weeks ago, though perhaps there's a few less despondent withered Tarnished sitting about.

Dee is nowhere to be seen, neither is Corhyn, but there's new faces --- or at least ones you haven't seen before --- standing across the great big table that gives the Hold its name.

A dark-haired man in ornate, polished armor, with a woman in a mail shirt, carrying shield, rapier, and halberd. The man is conversing with Gideon, who glances your way, but is trapped by social convention.

The woman looks over at you as well, with the discerning eye of a fighter, sizing you and your retinue up.

Titania pats you on the back. "Boc, let's just run down to Hewg; I think your armor needs re-fitting."

Boc looks down himself. "I suppose I have put on a few inches, haven't I?"

He hops up on the table to cross it, while Titania walks around it on long steps, leaving you alone with Roðrika.

"What is this place?" she asks.

"This is the Roundtable Hold," you explain. "A haven for Tarnished like you or I." You point to the rune suspended under the ceiling. "That is a rune of power, it makes it so no blood can be spilt in these halls; so you are quite safe. Though --- there's a woman who roams these halls who has some way of circumventing it. Her name is Fia. Do not accept her embrace or invitation to her bed."

"I see," Roðrika says. "And those three over there?"

"Man in the strange armor is Gideon Ofnir, closest thing we have to a proprietor. His domain is the library over yonder. He knows a lot of things, but is impolite --- at least to me. The other two, I don't know."

"And all these people?" Roðrika looks about at the many emaciated Tarnished.

"Lost souls. That big door to the north is locked. Behind us is the banquet hall."

Roðrika turns to look at the open doors, through which is the long table and the elaborate chandelier suspended above.

"There's also kitchens and utilities, but nobody to cook. You've already noticed, but hunger isn't deadly here in the lands between. You will also not grow sick with common disease."

Roðrika nods slowly, then looks at you. "Perhaps one day you could cook a banquet?" She smiles.

You blush. "I can't say the thought never occurred to me."

"What's through that door, then, where Nameless and Boc went?" Roðrika asks and points to the southeast.

"The forge. Master Hewg works there. He will see to any arms and armor you might need."

"Hopefully not much. And the last one?"

"If you need privacy and rest, there's an entire wing of living quarters and bedchambers that way; also rooms with piles of clothing and stacks of furniture, whatever you might need. But that is also the halls Fia stalks. Be wary."

Roðrika hugs herself. "I do feel a bit wary knowing there's a witch here so fierce even you're afraid of her."

You shrug. "She only has the power over you that you give her."

"Still. I would feel safer with an escort. I would like to secure a room for myself, here. Maybe stay a while."

Offering her an arm, she takes it, and you proceed into the domicile wing. Down the hall and up the stairs to the nicer bedchambers.

There you come across Fia, hauling a withered corpse along.

"Fia," you say coldly.

"Jester."

"This woman here, Lady Roðrika, is under my protection. If you touch her, I will touch you."

You see her face contort in contempt under her cowl. "I am not some base whore who accepts all comers," she says, and heads past you to the stairs.

"What?" Roðrika asks. "What did you mean by 'touch her' as a threat?"

"For some reason, if I touch her, she becomes badly burned."

Roðrika holds tighter onto your arm. "That was a corpse."

"It was. She preys on the lost souls. Don't end up like them." You continue down the hall to the room you once entertained Nepheli in.

"How would I go about that?"

"Find something to occupy yourself with. Perhaps Gideon needs another assistant, or Hewg has work for you. Or you could clean up the kitchens. Any number of things to do, here."

She snorts. "A noblewoman working as a scullery maid?"

You open the door to the small bedroom. There's charcoal in the box by the fireplace, and the bed is made --- just like you left it two months ago, if a little dustier. You toss a shovelful of coals in, and light a lively fire with a fingersnap.

"Any extra clothing you need you can just take from the room down the hall. Fia fills it with the possessions of her victims. Laundry you'll have to do yourself---"

The door closes.

"Jester, you've been so kind to me," Roðrika says. You stand and turn to her; she approaches you hands folded over her chest. She comes close enough that you can make out the strands of her blonde hair, and pulls back her red hood.

"I owe you far more than I can repay; such a good and kind soul you have." She reaches out with a soft hand and caresses your cheek. Then she stands on her toes to lean in and kiss you on your cheek."

But she doesn't pull back; instead she whispers in your ear: "_but you can stay the night if you wish._"

The heat on her breath tickles the hair at your temple, but you put a hand on her shoulder. As she steps back, you see confusion in her face.

"Oh, I beg pardon, was that too forward? I just assumed from the way you looked at me and your companions giving us privacy that---"

"Milady, Roðrika," you begin. "Not that I'm not tempted, you are a lovely and fair woman, but I fear you have the wrong idea."

She smiles. Confusion turns to disappointment. Truth is you'd rather not disappoint her, but you are too scrupulous to lead her on under false pretenses. Even though you're really feeling the need to relieve yourself of your sweltering gambeson.

"If you're looking to offer yourself as a reward for me saving you, I must decline on principle. If you are looking to win my heart, I must disappoint once more; already have a lover."

"Ah," she says, looking down and away. "Naturally, a woman as fine as you should already have a suitor."

You put aside your helmet and toss your gauntlets in it. "Well, it's more that I don't want you to expect to win my heart, I'd absolutely love to share your bed--- actually let me just--- Melina, got a second?" you call into the room.

A moment passes, then ash swirls from the fireplace and forms Melina in her cloak and dress, one eye golden, the other closed with the strange mark over the lid. "... Jester," she says. "Hello again, Lady Roðrika."

She looks from you to Melina and then back.

"You really ought to tell pretty women your real name afore you take them to bed, don't you think?" Melina says.

Roðrika's disappointment has turned back into confusion. "Wait--- so you're together, but..."

"I'm rather less corporeal than is needed to sate Ezekiel's needs," Melina continues. "So I lay no claim to her bed; only her heart. Also, I like to watch."

Now Roðrika blushes. "Oh. _Oh._ Well, I---" She looks at you.

You shrug your shoulders. Tension leaves you: it's up to her whims, now, and you're almost certain what the Lady Roðrika will choose. "That's the terms."

She chews on her cheek for a moment, her blush becoming more and more prominent. "Pardon my earlier attempt at seduction."

"Pardon granted," You say.

Melina crosses the floor in a gliding motion, coming up to thr two of you. With a delicate, scarred hand, she takes Roðrika's chin, and turns her head side to side as if inspecting goods for sale. Then she nods and looks at you. "She's more delicate than the lady warrior from the badlands you bedded two months ago. Take care not to break her."

Then she looks Roðrika in the eye. Blows her a kiss, and vanishes into ash.

Roðrika looks at where Melina just stood for a long moment, then at you, clearly flustered. "I--- I wasn't actually looking for anything other than some female company, I'm not looking for anything long term, not that it wouldn't be nice but just out of practicality; it's just been a long while since--- well all the way before I set out for the lands between, and I don't know if you know how it gets..."

You smile while she rambles, unsligning your sword and shield, unclasping your plate and tossing it aside, then pull your gambeson over your head, leaving you in shirt sleeves and chausses.

"_Oh dear,_" Roðrika mutters, as you step up to her.

"Like what you see?"

She puts a hand on your chest. "Ezekiel," she says, tasting the word. "It's a beautiful name."

"So is yours, Lady Roðrika." You untie the drawstrings of her cowl, letting the red velvet fall to the floor.

"But isn't it a man's name?"

"My father gave it to me when I was a child. My mother named me... something else, which I hated."

She leans in to kiss you; her lips taste of spiced meats and pickled fruit, she smells of a fine noblewoman's perfume. Your hands find her hips --- a slender waist and full curves.

A slow, long kiss, relishing her warm lips. She takes her time and you feel the heat rising in her cheeks, in her chest, and in her lap.

She kisses you with more courage, tasting you, taking your face in her hands. Then she pulls back.

"Am I not to your liking?" she asks.

"What?"

"You're just... so passive."

"I should take charge?"

Roðrika nods, and as she does, you take hold and pick her up by her hips. She gives a little yelp but wraps her legs around your hips and her arms around your neck.

"Something like this?"

She bites her lip. You kiss her again, and walk to the bed, laying her down gently. Her hands are on your back and yours in her hair; you rock your hips hard against hers.

You nibble on her lip and bite her neck, getting her to give a little squeal. "We're much too clothed for this!"

So you relieve her of her boots, and she, you of your arm wraps and shirt. Trousers and chausses get thrown on the floor, and her hands crawl over your every muscle and callous and bundle of sinews --- and you get to see such a contrast as between your warrior physique and her soft hands, smooth skin, and full curves.

A thigh behind your hand between her legs is all it takes to get her to scream and claw at the sheets, again and again and again. An instrument in your hands, bringing to mind a woman you once saw playing ten-string balisette.

Rhythmic, intentional, learning with every movement; almost as if her heat would burn your hand were you a lesser woman.

"Pause!" she calls out, drenched in sweat, and you give her respite, lying down beside her.

"Ezekiel," she breathes. "You make love like a demon."

Your fingers are drenched and were it not for countless hours holding a sword, your hand might be sore. "I try," you say with a roguish smile.

She runs a hand over your cheek. "I feel so selfish --- can I please you in any way?"

You lie back and let her. She kisses your neck and your collar bone and caresses your breasts, continuing down over your belly to your mound. With gentle hands she spreads your knees.

Her kiss is firm and her tongue slow. You play with her hair and let yourself get lost in the touch of a gentle lover. Then, through hooded eyes you see Melina lurking in the shadows, dress hiked up and one hand in her braies, biting her lip fiercely.

You wink at her and let climax take you.

----

Roðrika cuddles up to you, but neither of you find sleep.

"I... I think I'll stay here," she says.

"Do you think you'll be okay?"

"If you come by, once in a while."

"And we turn this into a regular thing?"

"No. I think that would complicate things for both of us --- I'd surely fall for you."

You smile.

She lets go of you and pushes herself up to sit.

"But thank you for this. I feel like you've lent me some of your courage and strength. What few sane people are here, perhaps they'll tolerate me. Perhaps I can be of use."

You sit up as well. "Hewg will take a liking to you, no doubt. He's a big softie."

-----

Down in the forge, Titania and Boc are chatting with Hewg; they've made a little occasion of it, drinking wine and sharing pickles. Hewg is explaining about the difficulty of making good needles, and Boc is listening with rapt attention.

Titania notices you come in with Roðrika trailing after. She sits on the floor with her back to the wall and pours you a cup without even asking or being asked. Not to be discourteous she also pours a cup for Roðrika.

"Master Hewg?" you ask.

He looks over at you. "Ah, Zeke, my boy. What do you need?"

That gives you pause for a moment. "I need you to meet Lady Roðrika. She'll be staying at the Hold for a while."

Hewg sizes her up, flicks his chain over his shoulder and comes up to Roðrika. He offers his hand, palm up. Roðrika takes it.

"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, milady. I am Hewg, Master of the Smithy here in the Hold. Not that I have much choice," he says and jostles the chain. "Anything you need in arms or armor, I'll provide."

"I'm more looking for a friendly face," she says. "I see the many poor souls who have lost the will to life; I do not wish to end up like them."

"Don't worry. That takes many hundred moons to end up suchwise. If'n you don't mind hammerblows, I'd appreciate company. Say, is that a calling bell on your hip?"

"Yes; yes it is. Are you familiar with the art?"

"Oh, I've dabbled --- though it's been a half-hundred moons since I held one. Ah," he chuckles, "now I want to fire up my silver forge and see if I still have a knack for bell-making. May I?"

She hands over her bell and Hewg taps it with a claw. "Why such a gentle creature you have there. A kraken. Rare specimen. Intelligent and loyal, too; 'tis fond of your gentle nature."

Roðrika seems surprised. "You know so much just from handling it?"

Hewg nods. "Craftsman's intuition, but I can teach you what I know, if it pleases."

She looks to you with a smile.

You smile back.

Hewg begins explaining, Boc listens in and offers his own bell to be examined.

Titania reaches up and touches her cup to yours in a wordless toast that still somehow teases you. An unspoken _congratulations on getting laid._

-----

You head into the library and leap over the railing, landing heavily on the lower floor. Gideon is at his usual perch behind his great big writing desk, books strewn about.

"What reason do you have to disturb me with such acrobatics?"

You walk up to the desk. "I know we don't get along, ser Ofnir, but I've brought a new resident to the Hold. Her name is Roðrika, she's a noblewoman who came here from my homelands. A kind soul, and a new friend of Hewg's. You're a good man. Treat her with politeness as she deserves."

He looks back into his books. "I have no quarrel with her. If she can be polite, I will be in turn."

"Good. Also Drake Agheel is dead, as is all her brood."

He looks up again. "Is that what you've been spending your time doing. What a generous service to Limgrave. See to it that you and yours get to Stormburg; it would be embarrassing if Nepheli had chosen such poor compatriots."

You lean on the table with both hands. "You're looking to ascend to be Elden Lord, right?"

"Nepheli told you."

"Then we can be tenuous allies, with our little antagonism games until it comes time to lay claim to the throne. And then it gets difficult."

"I'm sure. Get out of my library."

You head back to the staircase up and call on the fire under your feet to leap back up to the upper floor --- with no danger to the many books below, all the sparks and flames quell themselves immediately by your will.

In the main hall you run into the man in the ornate armor.

"Ah, I don't believe we've been acquainted. Diallos, Viscount of House Hoslow." He offers you a hand. "Though I suppose titles from other lands matter little, here."

You shake it. "Jester. No rank, family, or title, here or elsewhere."

"Ser Ofnir cautioned me against you. Called you uncouth."

"He's full of himself, I make fun of people who are full of themselves. I also bedded his daughter."

Diallos snorts. "I'd say you seem like better company than he."

"Staying long-term? Passing through?"

"We come by occasionally. The Hold is a convenient base of operations. Nepheli Loux, whom you apparently know a lot better than I, has recruited myself and my bodyguard Lanya to help her in a certain venture."

"Same for myself," you say. "My companions and I are going to Stormburg, soon. Though I haven't the foggiest of how to get inside the city --- my companions are Chimera and Hillfolk. I hear those are held in low regard, there, and us Tarnished are hunted."

"Oh. I suppose it's not common knowledge?" He takes out a small silver jar. "This 'furlcaller balm' is an extract of the common Erdleaf flower. The little orange ones with a pleasant smell?"

"I know of them."

"When minced in mutton fat and beeswax, it produces a paste that you simply apply to your eyelids. It makes it seem as though the light of Grace is still with you." He takes off his glove and demonstrates, dabbing a finger in the substance and applying a light swab of it on both eyelids.

Suddenly there's a shimmer in his eyes that wasn't there before --- one you've never noticed absent in the eyes of your fellow Tarnished.

"What are the ratios?"

"Two parts by weight of dried flowers, to one part warm fat and one part molten wax. Grind the flowers well with mortar and pestle, mix thoroughly, let cool. Lanya prepared this batch for us just the other day. It is dead easy."

You shake your head. "Diallos, I had no idea. Thank you greatly for this; such knowledge needs to be widely known among our fellow Tarnished."

He stares for a moment. "Good graces; if you didn't know, I must make sure to let every Tarnished I come across know! This is vital learning."

"I agree." You offer a hand, he wipes his finger in his surcoat and you shake hands once more. Shaking his ungloved hand, you feel a sharp ridge of scar tissue across his palm, such as you only ever saw on fishermen who had the lines cut their palms.

Strange.

"I'll get my seamster to cook me a batch --- he's good with concoctions. And then we'll see each other in Stormburg when the day comes, I guess?"

"I shall look forward to it." He turns and casts a glance about. "Now where did she run off to..."

"Your bodyguard?"

"Yes. She has a tendency to wander."

You giggle. "Pardon me, but it doesn't sound like much of a bodyguard."

"Difficult to be a bodyguard for an assassin in the first place, no?" He turns about and heads for the balcony area. "_Lanya?_" he calls out.

You stare after him.

At no point did you get the impression that he had ever killed a man, and you can usually tell at a glance. He wasn't even visibly armed.

-----

Three days later, you have seen to all your business in the Roundtable Hold, and you've has been back to Morning to make sure everything is in order.

Roðrika, you've helped to a hallow of grace in Morning, Fringefolk, and Haft, and a few in churches around Limgrave, so she won't be confined to the Hold, and Boc has cooked her a jar of the Erdleaf flower balm.

Now, atop Torrent, you ride into the city proper.

Stormburg is not like Morning. It is not like Haft or Fringefolk, it is not like Ishe in your home country. It is far, far larger. It has walls that rival Morning's but puts Haft to shame, the gates are wide open and traffic in and out is bustling. Especially soldiers mobilizing; but you even spot carts of grain among the traffic, and herds of sheep.

Not enough by far to feed the city, but some, at least. Much the same as Haft and Fringefolk.
