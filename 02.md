# An Accord

You wake up a little later --- the sun is climbing in the sky. You're hungry and thirsty, but Blaidd's reassurances seem credible: you don't feel weak or sluggish.

Blaidd himself is nowhere to be seen, but the horse is still there, walking about, grazing and browsing the greenery.

You shrug off your cloak and stand to stretch. The fight, yesterday is fresh in your mind. You look at your hand and focus forming a heavy golden sphere.

Squishing it between your fingers, the golden glittery smoke wraps itself around you again.

You're apparently rich, now.

Putting that thought aside, you unsheathe your sword and take out your whetstone, giving the blade some much needed maintenance while in the light of the Grace.

And then something happens; some<em>one</em> happens. A cloaked figure appears beside you from out of the morning air in a swirl of motes of ash.

"We meet again, traveler from beyond the fog..."

You recognize the voice, the one who gave you the restorative. She steps close and kneels down to sit by the Grace.

With slender hands she throws back her hood revealing auburn locks and a face of delicate features. Her left eye bears a black scarring mark across the lid and down the cheek.

"I am Melina."

She is irrefutably fair, and captivates your attention quite fully.

"I offer you an accord."

You nod slowly.

"Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?"

You clear your throat. "Some."

"They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance and aid to the Tarnished."

"So I heard."

She continues: "You are maidenless, are you not?"

"For the time being." You venture: "Are--- are you offering?"

Melina tilts her head. "I can play the role of Finger Maiden, though I am not it. Turning runes into strength, to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring."

That sounds undeniably appealing. "And in exchange?"

"You need only take me with you to the foot of the Erdtree."

You reach under your veil to scratch your chin. "Should my travels take me there, you are welcome to follow. I confess I know not what the Elden Ring is, nor do I search for it."

"You are guided by Grace, Ezekiel. You are searching for the Elden Ring, even if you do not know it."

You reach out to grab the hilt of your sword. "How do you know my name?"

"I know the names of all Tarnished warriors."

Sinister. You do not let go of your sword, in the company of this witch.

"I accept your accord then."

"Then it is settled. Say my name to summon me by Grace, and I will turn your runes to strength and offer guidance."

"Melina." You taste the word. "You can count on it," you say with a genuine smile.

She bows. "Another matter," she stands up, and from another swirl of ash comes a steed --- a small horse with the horns of some kind of elk. You remember it from your first meeting. "This is Torrent. A spectral steed. I bequeath him you; by his own choice. Treat him with respect --- he will come to you with but a whistle."

You stand as well, and carefully approach the animal, hand outstretched, palm up. Torrent sniffs and then nibbles at your palm.

"Sorry, Torrent," you mutter. "I have no treats for you --- I'm hungry also."

He is no larger than a pony, and his fur is coarse under your hands. He is fit with a saddle and saddlebags --- you peek inside finding them very spacious. Strangely so, even. You give him a good scratching on the neck, which he seems to like immensely.

"Melina, I've rather a large bounty of runes with me from killing a knight yestereve... Perhaps you could demonstrate with, say, two thirds of it?" You say it without turning away from giving Torrent attention.

"Certainly. Take my hand." She holds it out, palm up.

You look at her and take of your gauntlet, undoing your hand wrap, then reach out and offer yours palm up, gently turning hers over. The back of her hand is criss-crossed in scarring.

Then you feel as though you can accomplish greater feats --- of strength, of speed, of _faith,_ even.

You withdraw from her touch, slightly startled. You look at your hand and rub your fingertips together, then making a fist.

"Another question if you will humor my curiosity: how did you just appear out of thin air?"

"In mine own way. But you may master a similar mode of travel, through Grace."

"How?"

"I do not know how in detail; only that other Tarnished do it."

"Thank you, Melina. I wish I had hospitality to offer you."

"No need, Ezekiel. You are but one of many Tarnished I help --- sorry if you get the impression that my interest in you is special."

Your heart sinks a little. "I understand. That does not mean you are not owed kindness and thanks --- so my father taught me."

She takes another bow, and you mirror her.

"Fare thee well, Ezekiel. May we meet again."

Then she vanishes into ash.

Torrent walks off --- perhaps to search for Blaidd's horse to greet one another as such beasts do, and you draw your sword to do some fencing forms and test if your news strength is real.

-----

Blaidd comes back not long after.

"Where did you get a horse, Jester?"

"A strange woman appeared out of thin air and gave it me."

He seems on guard. "Did she? What was her name?"

"Melina. What is it to you, ser Blaidd?"

He shakes his head. "I just believe that strange women appearing from thin air distributing horned horses is no way to expedite an Elden Lord."

You shrug. "I am still not sold on the business of 'seeking the Elden Ring' and whatnot. What even is it?"

He whistles loudly and his horse comes back into the church ruin through a collapsed segment of wall.

"The Law of the Lands Between. It was a great artefact of Runes great and small, in which was writ the Law of Causality. The rules that govern the very nature of all things."

Blaidd checks the saddle and shows the horse some affection.

"Like death, famine, and pestilence."

"Yes. In the beginning, things died true death according to fate and destiny. Now they do not."

"Because death was removed from the Elden Ring."

"Aye. But it no longer exists. Queen Marika broke it in the Shattering."

"Then how am I supposed to seek it?"

He shrugs, and mounts up --- the horse lets him. "What's a good name for a horse?"

"Beats me."

Blaidd pats her on the neck. "I think 'Roach' will do. Same as my previous horse."

"What happened to that one?"

"Old age."

You put two fingers to your lips and whistle. Rather than come running, Torrent appears from thin air beside you, startling you some. He lets you mount up, and you find it quite easy.

Then Blaidd turns Roach towards the church gate and spurs her into a gentle trot, and you follow his example.

"How old are you, exactly, ser Blaidd?"

"Depends on by what calendar."

"In count of years? Seasons? Moons? I know not what you count here."

"I've lived for a long age, in servitude of my mistress. As long as her."

"And who is your mistress?"

He shakes his head.

You ride on in silence.

-----

By midday, you reach the township. It is maybe two dozen houses of wood at a crossroads, with some cleared land around growing grains and herbs --- by your estimate far too little to feed everyone in town.

"I will find Darriwil's scent. You ask around where a traitor knight might hide."
