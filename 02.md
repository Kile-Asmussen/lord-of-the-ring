# An Accord

You wake up a little later --- the sun is climbing in the sky. You're hungry and thirsty, but Blaidd's reassurances seem credible: you don't feel weak or sluggish.

Blaidd himself is nowhere to be seen, but the horse is still there, walking about, grazing and browsing the greenery.

You shrug off your cloak and stand to stretch. The fight, yesterday is fresh in your mind. You look at your hand and focus forming a heavy golden sphere.

Squishing it between your fingers, the golden glittery smoke wraps itself around you again.

You're apparently rich, now.

Putting that thought aside, you unsheathe your sword and take out your whetstone, giving the blade some much needed maintenance while in the light of the Grace.

And then something happens; some<em>one</em> happens. A cloaked figure appears beside you from out of the morning air in a swirl of motes of ash.

"We meet again, traveler from beyond the fog..."

You recognize the voice.

"I am Melina."

She steps close and kneels down to sit by the Grace.

With slender hands she throws back her hood revealing auburn locks and a face of delicate features. Her left eye bears a black scarring mark across the lid and down the cheek.

She is irrefutably fair, and captivates your attention quite fully.

"I offer you an accord."

You nod slowly.

"Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?"

You clear your throat. "Some."

"They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance and aid to the Tarnished."

"So I heard."

She continues: "You are maidenless, are you not?"

"For the time being." You venture: "Are--- are you offering?"

Melina tilts her head. "I can play the role of Finger Maiden. Turning runes into strength, to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring."

That sounds undeniably appealing. "And in exchange?"

"You need only take me with you to the foot of the Erdtree."

You reach under your veil to scratch your chin. "Should my travels take me there, you are welcome to follow. I confess I know not what the Elden Ring is, nor do I search for it."

"You are guided by Grace, Ezekiel. You are searching for the Elden Ring, even if you do not know it."

You reach out to grab the hilt of your sword. "How do you know my name?"

"I know the names of all Tarnished warriors."

Sinister. You do not let go of your sword, in the company of this witch.

"I accept your accord then."

"Then it is settled. Say my name to summon me by Grace, and I will turn your runes to strength and offer guidance."

"Melina." You taste the word.

She bows. "Another matter," she stands up, and from another swirl of ash comes a steed --- a small horse with the horns of some kind of elk. You remember it from your first meeting. "This is Torrent. A spectral steed. I bequeath him you; by his own choice. Treat him with respect --- he will come to you with but a whistle."

"I've rather a large bounty of runes with me from killing a knight, yestereve... Perhaps you could demonstrate with, say, two thirds of it?"



"How did you just appear out of thin air?"
