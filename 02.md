# Accords

You wake up a little later --- the sun is climbing in the sky. You're hungry and thirsty, but Blaidd's reassurances seem credible: you don't feel weak or sluggish.

Blaidd himself is nowhere to be seen, but the horse is still there, walking about, grazing and browsing the greenery.

You shrug off your cloak and stand to stretch. The fight, yesterday is fresh in your mind. You look at your hand and focus forming a heavy golden sphere.

Squishing it between your fingers, the golden glittery smoke wraps itself around you again.

You're apparently rich, now.

Putting that thought aside, you unsheathe your sword and take out your whetstone, giving the blade some much needed maintenance while in the light of the Grace.

And then something happens; some<em>one</em> happens. A cloaked figure appears beside you from out of the morning air in a swirl of motes of ash.

"We meet again, traveler from beyond the fog..."

You recognize the voice, the one who gave you the restorative. She steps close and kneels down to sit by the Grace.

With slender hands she throws back her hood revealing auburn locks and a face of delicate features. Her left eye bears a black scarring mark across the lid and down the cheek.

"I am Melina."

She is irrefutably fair, and captivates your attention quite fully.

"I offer you an accord."

You nod slowly.

"Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?"

You clear your throat. "Some."

"They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance and aid to the Tarnished."

"So I heard."

She continues: "You are maidenless, are you not?"

"For the time being." You venture: "Are--- are you offering?"

Melina tilts her head. "I can play the role of Finger Maiden, turning runes into strength to aid you in your search for the Elden Ring."

That sounds undeniably appealing. "And in exchange?"

"You need only take me with you to the foot of the Erdtree."

You reach under your veil to scratch your chin. "Should my travels take me there, you are welcome to follow. I confess I know not what the Elden Ring is, nor do I search for it."

"You are guided by Grace, Ezekiel."

You reach out to grab the hilt of your sword. "How do you know my name?"

"I know the names of all Tarnished warriors."

Sinister. You do not let go of your sword, in the company of this witch.

She gestures to the Grace. "This tiny golden aura is the Grace of the Erdtree. This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren. But now it is all that guides you, or so I hear, the rays of Grace that guide you through your burden. If the rays of Grace signal you to press on, then the Elden Ring beckons you. As an ally by pact, I pray that you are fit to face the challenge presented by the Ring."

You ponder this for a moment, and decide to ask someone else what this Elden Ring is.

"I accept your accord."

"Then it is settled. Say my name to summon me by Grace, and I will turn your runes to strength and offer guidance."

"Melina." You taste the word. "You can count on it," you say with a genuine smile.

She bows. "Another matter," she stands up, and from another swirl of ash comes a steed --- a small horse with the horns of some kind of elk. You remember it from your first meeting. "This is Torrent. A spectral steed. I bequeath him you; by his own choice. Treat him with respect --- he will come to you with but a whistle."

You stand as well, and carefully approach the animal, hand outstretched, palm up. Torrent sniffs and then nibbles at your palm.

"Sorry, Torrent," you mutter. "I have no treats for you --- I'm hungry also."

He is no larger than a pony, and his fur is coarse under your hands. He is fit with a saddle and saddlebags --- you peek inside finding them very spacious. Strangely so, even. You give him a good scratching on the neck, which he seems to like immensely.

"Melina, I've rather a large bounty of runes with me from killing a knight yestereve... Perhaps you could demonstrate with, say, two thirds of it?" You say it without turning away from giving Torrent attention.

"As promised. Lend your hand to me, for but a moment. Share them with me, your thoughts, your ambitions, the principles you would follow." She holds it out, palm up.

You look at her and take of your gauntlet, undoing your hand wrap, then reach out and offer yours palm up, gently turning hers over. The back of her hand is criss-crossed in scarring.

Then you feel as though you can accomplish greater feats --- of strength, of speed, of _faith,_ even.

You withdraw from her touch, slightly startled. You look at your hand and rub your fingertips together, then making a fist.

"Another question if you will humor my curiosity: how did you just appear out of thin air?"

"In mine own way. But you may master a similar mode of travel, through Grace."

"How?"

"I do not know how in detail; only that other Tarnished do it."

"Thank you, Melina. I wish I had hospitality to offer you."

"No need, Ezekiel. You are but one of many Tarnished I help --- sorry if you get the impression that my interest in you is special."

Your heart sinks a little. "I understand. That does not mean you are not owed kindness and thanks --- so my father taught me."

She takes another bow, and you mirror her.

"Fare thee well, Ezekiel. May we meet again."

Then she vanishes into ash.

Torrent walks off --- perhaps to search for Blaidd's horse to greet one another as such beasts do, and you draw your sword to do some fencing forms and test if your news strength is real.

-----

Blaidd comes back not long after.

"Where did you get a horse, Jester?"

"A strange woman appeared out of thin air and gave it me."

He seems on guard. "Did she? What was her name?"

"Melina. What is it to you, ser Blaidd?"

He shakes his head. "I just believe that strange women appearing from thin air distributing horned horses is no way to expedite an Elden Lord."

You shrug. "I am still not sold on the business of 'seeking the Elden Ring' and whatnot. What even is it?"

He whistles loudly and his horse comes back into the church ruin through a collapsed segment of wall.

"The Law of the Lands Between. It was a great artefact of Runes great and small, in which was writ the Law of Causality. The rules that govern the very nature of all things."

Blaidd checks the saddle and shows the horse some affection.

"Like death, famine, and pestilence."

"Yes. In the beginning, things died true death according to fate and destiny. Now they do not."

"Because death was removed from the Elden Ring."

"Aye. But it no longer exists. Queen Marika broke it in the Shattering."

"Then how am I supposed to seek it?"

He shrugs, and mounts up --- the horse lets him. "What's a good name for a horse?"

"Beats me."

Blaidd pats her on the neck. "I think 'Roach' will do. Same as my previous horse."

"What happened to that one?"

"Old age."

You put two fingers to your lips and whistle. Rather than come running, Torrent appears from thin air beside you, startling you some. He lets you mount up, and you find it quite easy.

Then Blaidd turns Roach towards the church gate and spurs her into a gentle trot, and you follow his example.

"How old are you, exactly, ser Blaidd?"

"Depends on by what calendar."

"In count of years? Seasons? Moons? I know not what you count here."

"I've lived for a long age, in servitude of my mistress. As long as her."

"And who is your mistress?"

He shakes his head.

You ride on in silence.

-----

By midday, you reach the township. It is maybe two dozen houses of stone at a crossroads, with some cleared land around growing grains and herbs --- by your estimate far too little to feed everyone in town.

"I will find Darriwil's scent. You ask around where a traitor knight might hide."

"And they will not mind I am Tarnished?"

He grunts. "Less than my being a wolfman. We'll meet by the southern gate."

You dismount Torrent and he fades into nothing. Then you continue on foot along the road, while Blaidd rides off, away from the path.

Passing under the gate delineating the village border feels... significant. You head along to the center of the crossroads, hoping to find someone to ask.

It soon becomes apparent that the villagers are afraid --- even as this place ought to see a lot of traffic, and anybody traveling the roads ought to carry weapons. They see you coming and hurry to keep their distance.

A young man comes up to you. His clothes are in worse condition than yours --- which is saying something. Everyone in the town seem poor beyond measure.

"We don't wan't any trouble, ser," he says, clearly brandishing the walking stick he carries as a quarterstaff.

"I come bearing no quarrel. I am searching for a traitor knight, name of Darriwil --- where would such a man hide?"

"Please leave, ma'am."

"Young man, you are very brave or very stupid. Go home to your family and rest assured I will not draw my sword in---"

Something hits you hard and painfully in the back. A rock. The young man runs off. Was he a distraction?

You turn to see a strange scene. A younger man --- perhaps just a boy --- is being held by one arm in the air, feet dangling, by an enormous person.

"_Don't go throwing rocks at strangers,_" the giant yells in a rumble.

They are dressed in clothing as concealing as yours, but far less coherently. A cloak across the shoulders, leg-wraps from two different kinds of fabric. A cap with long flaps over the ears and down the neck, scarf over the face. Their body proportions are strange in ways you can't place.

They drop the boy, and he runs off, a wet stain on his trousers.

You wonder how you missed this presence in the town on your way in. "Thank you, kind stranger!"

They look to you. "Mind your business." They turn and leave, walking in a strange gait.

-----

Blaidd comes to the south gate as the sun starts descending in the sky. "I picked up Darriwil's scent."

"Good, because I got asked to leave, had a rock thrown at me, and met this weird giant-sized person who saved me from being stoned but told me to beat it when I thanked them."

"Sounds better than a lot of the alternatives."

You whistle for Torrent and he appears immediately for you to mount up. You'll have to take care to remember to care for him and not begin to take him for granted.

Blaidd leads the way, out of the clearing for the village and through more forest before reaching a stretch of open land, hilly grass and shrublands broken by rock formations.

You spot on top of a low cliff the telltale shimmer in the air of Grace, and steer Torrent towards it. There seems to be no way up.

Torrent snorts.

"What is it, boy?"

Then without your prompting, Torrent takes a run-up and leaps up as far as your combined height, onto an outcropping of rock.

Holding on for dear life as your steed climbs up the cliff, he eventually delivers you safely by the Grace. You dismount and reach out to touch it. Warm like a little bird.

Your heart yearns to stay, but you mount Torrent --- Blaidd is riding on ahead already. "Can you get us down again, boy?"

Torrent answers by leaping off the cliff entire, and just before you both hit the ground with leg-breaking force, somehow a great wind rushes up around you, slowing your fall.

Then he sets into a gallop, catching up to Blaidd on Roach.

You lean forward and mutter to him: "_Torrent, boy, you deserve a treat for that, I promise._"

"What's that?" Blaidd asks.

"Never mind."

He grunts, and you ride on somewhat further. "We're getting close."

The sky is dark and full of stars when you reach your destination: a great circle of paving stones, with an ornate iron plate inlaid in the middle, severely rusted, but giving off an eerie glow in the dark.

"An evergaol. Darriwil, Darriwil, Darriwil... rotting in a cell is no true justice."

"What now?" you ask.

"We enter the evergaol and slay him."

"And how do we get... out?"

"Those not imprisoned are free to leave."

You shrug. "If you get us trapped in there, I'll kill you and then myself."

Blaidd barks out a laugh. "Don't worry, Jester. I'll fight him head on. Keep him off my back --- he'll be fast."

He draws his sword and steps onto the iron circle, and you follow. Then the paved stone circle seems to rise up around them, becoming a dome overhead, and leaving them in a wide chamber with walls of translucent fog. The floor is some kind of clear water, solid enough to stand on.

Off to the side is a strange figure, clad in armor and with legs and arms like a man, but crouched over on all fours like a beast. One hand holds an enormous wicked curved blade, the other has the gauntlet adorned with a pair of claws.

"Darriwil. It's over."

The monster flings itself at Blaidd, who expertly brings his huge blade up to parry the swipe from the curved sword, dodging the claw. He is an expert fighter you can tell just from that.

You keep up best as you can while the two clash three more times, staying behind Blaidd, ready to take a swing at the monstrous knight if he tries to---

Darriwil's form flickers vanishes from view and then he's on you. You parry his swing, but the claws catch you in the flank, setting your entire side on fire with pain.

Somehow you don't keel over then and there. Instead you grab hold of his bladed gauntlet with all your strength and swing your sword at him.

He parries, but your swing is not the danger.

Blaidd brings his blade down in a leap, plunging the huge sword through the monster's back, and from it comes a wave of icy air and frost. As he rips it out again comes a blast of snow leaving ice in your brows and on your clothes.

Your quarry's life ends in an instant.

Before letting go of the claw in your side, you take out the restorative flask, and put it to your lips before letting the two blades out of your flesh.

The pain almost makes you gag, but you quaff the brew anyway, and your pain eases quickly.

"Are you alright, Jester? That was a severe wound."

"Not even the first time I've been stabbed nearly to death."

Blaidd grabs hold of one of the dead man's feet and drags the corpse onto the metal plate. You stagger after, hand on your side --- healing is not painless.

The paving stones descend to become the floor once more, and the fresh night air replaces the staleness of the evergaol.

Then Blaidd starts the process of picking apart the dead man's possessions.

In particular he relieves the corpse of armor and weapons discarding most, but sheathing the curved blade in the scabbard Darriwil kept on his back, and the claws which have two individual things of leather joined by string to keep it safe for transport.

He hands both to you. "Here."

"What do I need them for?"

"Trophies. You fought well."

You receive the two weapons. "Is this the reward you spoke of?"

Blaidd chuckles. "No, no." Then he draws a hand over the corpse, scraping off some kind of grey substance, and collecting it in a jar. He hands that to you as well.

"Ashes of war."

"Which is?"

"You saw how he moved? That is not how mortals can move unaided. These are the remains of some great beast or some-such, I know not. But should you smear these on yourself, this power will settle in your bones and let you move in this manner."

"And how do I get rid of them?"

"Just scrape them off your skin."

Nothing in these lands make sense.

"Now, for your reward." He reaches into a pouch and takes forth a large white stone.

"What's that?"

"A Somber Stone. It holds great violence inside, a skilled smith can use its powder to temper your blade with destruction --- or armor and shields with protection."

You take the heavy item from him. "And where might I find such a smith?"

Blaidd looks north. "Should you ever venture up to Liurnia, you may come to find a venerable fellow who is a bit on the large side --- Iji is his name. He is clever with a furnace and hammer, he can do it."

You whistle for Torrent and stow the stone and claw in his saddle bag, tying the sword to the saddle's scabbard hold. Perhaps it will do good for horseback combat, though it is superfluous with your father's sword.

"I'd like a share of the runes from that man," you say. "Not to be ungrateful."

Blaidd hands you a heavy ball of gold. Then he whistles for Roach. "I'll be on my way now, back north. May we meet again."

He mounts up and rides off, leaving you alone.

You mount up and head back to the cliff with the Grace. There Torrent once more climbs the rock face, and you curl up by the light, falling asleep, hungry.

-----

Morning comes cold. There's something solid against your back, and you realize it's Torrent.

"Hey boy.
