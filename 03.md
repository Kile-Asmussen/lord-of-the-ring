# Is Someone There?

The remains of the day, you spend with Titania, showing her sword form. She has no training in swordsmanship and watching her swing the curved blade like a cleaver makes you wince.

You leave her to leap about and climb the trees like an excitable child, learning the sword by swinging it about like your father encouraged.

You go sit by the Grace for some time, resting. The hunger still gnaws at you, but it is almost starting to become... normal. You dread what it'll be like to actually eat when the time comes.

Somehow, you're tired.

"Melina."

She appears moments later.

"Ezekiel."

"I have a question ---" you take out the little golden flask of restorative medicine "--- got anymore of these?"

"For what do you need it?"

"_Hey! Zeke!_"

You turn to look at Titania. She throws a heavy stick forth and as it flies away from her, she vanishes from sight, and faster than the eye can see cuts the stick in half.

"_I figured it out!_"

"Her."

"Who is that?"

"A friend. Can you also turn runes into strength for her?"

Melina keeps staring at Titania. "Is that a _misbegotten chimera?_"

"You're very observant." Somehow you're also more interested in looking at your new friend rolling about and laughing.

She turns back to look at you, and for the first time you see her with an expression of something other than neutrality. She looks deeply perplexed.

You smile. Making an impression is important.

"So. Bottle, runes into strength, are those services exclusive to Tarnished?"

"I--- I mean I--- I can certainly brew you another dose of restorative from a golden seed of the erdtree, and a sacred tear. As for runes... I suppose I can. I've never done so before --- Ezekiel, what in all the land?"

You shrug. "I've decided to become Elden Lord. A Lord needs knights, no?"

Melina gestures emphatically. "A _bloodhound knight misbegotten chimera?!_"

"What, never seen one of those before? They're all over the place down here by the Weeping Insula."

She stares at you for a long spell, then she giggles. "You are a jester."

"They call me that, you know. Jester."

Titania has laid down out among the shrubs, looking up at the twilight sky.

Melina stands. "Good luck in your travels." Then she vanishes into ash.

Atop a tower, night sky above.

Something falls from the cosmos.

It lands before you.

Median, annulary.

They twitch.

You wake up there, between the two old trees by the Grace. It is evening.

"Oh, you're awake! I found food!"

That gets you back to your senses, and you see Titania sling an entire goat from off her shoulder. Its throat has been cut, and there's a lot of blood in the fur.

"Did you let it bleed out?" is your first question.

"I didn't want to get blood on my cloak, so I held it upside down for a while until it stopped bleeding."

You emerge from your cloak, and your hunger is more present than ever. "We need firewood and a large flat stone, I'll do the butchering." You remove your gauntlets and armwraps to avoid getting guts on them.

"Who was that one you talked to?" Titania asks you.

"Melina. She's... some kind of woman. She'll help us later."
