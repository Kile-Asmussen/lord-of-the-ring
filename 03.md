# Is Someone There?

The remains of the day, you spend with Titania, showing her sword form. She has no training in swordsmanship and watching her swing the curved blade like a cleaver makes you wince.

You leave her to leap about and climb the trees like an excitable child, learning the sword by swinging it about like your father encouraged.

You go sit by the Grace for some time, resting. The hunger still gnaws at you, but it is almost starting to become... normal. You dread what it'll be like to actually eat when the time comes.

Somehow, you're tired.

"Melina."

She appears moments later.

"Ezekiel."

"I have a question ---" you take out the little golden flask of restorative medicine "--- got anymore of these?"

"For what do you need it?"

"_Hey! Zeke!_"

You turn to look at Titania. She throws a heavy stick forth and as it flies away from her, she vanishes from sight, and faster than the eye can see cuts the stick in half.

"_I figured it out!_"

"Her."

"Who is that?"

"A friend. Can you also turn runes into strength for her?"

Melina keeps staring at Titania. "Is that a _misbegotten chimera?_"

"You're very observant." Somehow you're also more interested in looking at your new friend rolling about and laughing.

She turns back to look at you, and for the first time you see her with an expression of something other than neutrality. She looks deeply perplexed.

You smile. Making an impression is important.

"So. Bottle, runes into strength, are those services exclusive to Tarnished?"

"I--- I mean I--- I can certainly brew you another dose of restorative from a golden seed of the erdtree, and a sacred tear. As for runes... I suppose I can. I've never done so before --- Ezekiel, what in all the land?"

You shrug. "I've decided to become Elden Lord. A Lord needs knights, no?"

Melina gestures emphatically. "A _bloodhound knight misbegotten chimera?!_"

"What, never seen one of those before? They're all over the place down here by the Weeping Insula."

She stares at you for a long spell, then she giggles. "You are a jester."

"They call me that, you know. Jester."

Titania has laid down out among the shrubs, looking up at the twilight sky.

Melina stands. "Good luck in your travels." Then she vanishes into ash.

Atop a tower, night sky above.

Something falls from the cosmos.

It lands before you.

Median, annulary.

They twitch.

You wake up there, between the two old trees by the Grace. It is evening.

"Oh, you're awake! I found food!"

That gets you back to your senses, and you see Titania sling an entire goat from off her shoulder. Its throat has been cut, and there's a lot of blood in the fur.

"Did you let it bleed out?" is your first question.

"I didn't want to get blood on my cloak, so I held it upside down for a while until it stopped bleeding."

You emerge from your cloak, and your hunger is more present than ever. "We need firewood and a large flat stone, I'll do the butchering." You remove your gauntlets and armwraps to avoid getting guts on them.

"Who was that one you talked to?" Titania asks.

You draw your dagger and roll the goat's belly upwards a little, and lay a cut along the centerline to begin skinning it.

"Melina. She's... some kind of woman. She'll help us later."

Titania goes off in search of firewood, and you go proceed with the butchering: gutting and cleaning; jointing the hooves, shoulders, and hips. It is hard work, and your apatite grows.

When she returns, you have to show her how to build a fire --- as close to the Grace as is feasible without being under the low canopies and risking setting the trees ablaze. You teach her to use flint and tinder

Seeing the flames rise is invigorating.

"Say, do you know if meat rots?"

Titania looks at you. "What?"

"I'm thinking we can't eat all this meat, and I've nothing to cure it with..."

"I don't know, I mean... hm. I guess a few weeks ago I ate from a carcass some wolves had left behind I thin, and it was... dry?"

"Flies? Maggots?"

"What are those?"

You whistle for Torrent, and stow the legs of the goat in his roomy saddle bags. The meat you cut to eat is from the shoulder and back of the animal. You let the initial fire burn down to embers and skewer slivers of meat on whittled sticks --- when you make it to Morning, you'll have to visit a smith for a skillet and a potter for a cooking pot. And a bowyer and fletcher for hunting implements. And a salt merchant...

Titania is content to eat slivers of meat raw; you lend her your dagger to pluck the carcass. You'll have to find her a utility knife. You also need one --- a dagger is a poor replacement for a good knife.

Whatever were you thinking, setting off for the Lands Between without proper gear...

You watch her pick apart the dead goat, slurping down narrow strips of meat.

Staring into the fire you think of that strange dream. "Isn't it weird?"

"Hm?"

"Titania, how in all the land did we become friends?"

She chews and swallows. "I thought you were misbegotten. I asked you for help. I realized I was wrong. You wanted to help anyway and made an effort to gain my trust and gave me arms and a name, like, just because?"

"Why did you ask me for help?"

"You seemed... trustworthy. And the kids throwing rocks, that was just... kids shouldn't throw rocks at people."

"I seemed... trustworthy?"

"And then I saw you come out of the stone circle with a dead guy who looked like he had been really scary, and that guy with the wolf head. Figured you had fought together, that you were strong."

Titania looks at the meat you're cooking, and then into the fire. "I... also had a dream, the night after I followed you and the wolfman."

"Oh?"

"I was atop a tower, and there was like, this great big hand --- but it was missing three fingers."

"I've had that dream too, just today."

That is certainly a coincidence. "Ever dream of fire?"

"Sometimes."

"How old are you?"

"Hm... Thirty-ish passings of the seasons?"

You don't know precisely either, but probably around thirty. "Me too."

Taking one of the spits out of the fire, you poke the thin piece of meat. It feels done, so you pull it off and eat it, tearing off chunks with your teeth like an animal.

Titania seems trustworthy, too, somehow. Fate is surely playing a trick, pushing the two of you together.

----

You wake up by the Grace, to a foggy morning, sitting nestled up against Titania. You fell asleep by the fire, which has now burned out --- she must have moved you.

Somehow you don't mind. She breathes slowly.

Is this love? Surely not --- you've no desire to see her unclothed, except perhaps to bathe together, or to tend to her wounds. Bathing is perhaps a good thing to consider. She smells quite strongly --- not unpleasantly, just animalistic and unwashed.

Maybe it's a different kind of love.

Maybe you two are meant to be together.

It feels right. One day you might be Lord, and she will be your Knight.

You look up at her face, peaceful in expression. Reaching out of your cloak to stroke her cheek causes her to stir.

"Hey," you say.

"Hey," she rumbles back.

You get up and stretch, Titania does the same, but on all fours like a great big cat.

Whistling for Torrent causes him to appear, and you set off out to the cliffs, and along them towards the bridge, now invisible in the fog.

You ride Torrent; Titania has long legs with strange joints and no trouble traversing the rough terrain.

"We need to get you a horse."

"It'd have to be a big one."

As the bridge comes into view, you both cover your faces, and head onto the road. There's soldiers stationed there, with great ballistae pointed towards the Weeping Insula, rather than away. They let you pass quite unmolested.

You wonder if you will have to fight your way through that blockade --- you hope traveling with Grace will prove to let you bring Titania along.

"Do you think this is about the uprising?" you ask.

"Maybe."
