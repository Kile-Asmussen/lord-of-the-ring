# A Face not Seen before

Through the dark, Titania's hand gives you comfort. The tunnel stinks of clay.

"How much longer?"

"Not far."

The tunnel opens somewhat and Titania stops. "Ladder, here." She puts your hand on the post of the ladder, and swings herself up past you. You climb up, having to look down to not have sand fall in your eyes from her feet.

And then she stops. "Trap door." She grunts with exertion. "They've blocked it."

"Do we go back?"

"Let me just..." She grunts louder and you hear the ladder creak. Then a crack of light above nearly blinds you. Titania shoves the claws of her gauntlet through to keep it open and repositions to brace against the wall.

With a mighty heave and the smashing and crashing of things falling over, Titania emerges into the rooms above.

She reaches down and pulls you up with ease. Whatever Melina did to her, Titania is now terrifyingly strong.

"So what now?" you ask.

Titania unwraps the scarf around her head and takes off her hat, revealing knotted and dirty deep red hair. "From here on out, I'm the one in charge --- do you have any rope?"

You don't. You should have purchased some from Kal√© or the other merchant. But you are in a store room. "Let's look for some."

In one of the boxes you do indeed find rope, and Titania reveals her plan. "I know it sounds bad, but we'll have to pretend you're my prisoner. Give me your weapons, and tie this around your neck."

"Okay."

"Okay? You don't have any objections?"

"You're my Shadow."

She slings your father's sword on her back, and takes your dagger in her belt, then she takes the rope in hand, as if you're an animal on a lead.

Then you head into the street.

Above stretches buildings tall and strangely built, with streets on multiple levels.

"Morne is built in a gorge," Titania explains. "The harbor is at the bottom. This way."

The streets are lined with crucifixes with mummified remains strung up, and chimeras walk about the streets --- seeming for all in the world like ordinary people. They wear clothes in the form of skirts and cloaks, and some of them carry great big cleavers. Some of them look your way, sure, but Titania is recognizably one of theirs, and visibly armed.

As you walk down one of the narrow streets, a group of three stops you. Their hair is white, and one of them has some kind of growth on her face, while the other two have tails. All three of them are armed, and they are all somewhat bigger than Titania.

"Ey, what have we here?"

"None of your business," Titania says.

"Human on a leash? Seems like our business," another says.

"I'm going to the castle to present this one ---" Titania tugs on your lead, and you stumble on purpose "--- to the boss. Found her snooping around. Says she's one of King Godrick's, and they're planning a huge siege."

The three look at each other. "Why don't we do that for you? A scrawny little female like yourself shouldn't be out and about hunting down spies."

"I can beat up all of you, so why don't you scram?"

One of them swings at Titania, and she ducks under and lays an uppercut at his chin hard enough that you hear bone breaking. He staggers back and nearly falls over the railing onto the roof of a building below.

Titania shakes her hand. "Either of you two fool enough to make me draw a blade?" she growls.

They grab their buddy and hobble off.

You head further down into the gorge, where daylight becomes scarce, down steps and sloping streets until, and then upwards again, to a great big bridge, stretching into the fog --- only as you set foot on the bridge, a strong gust clears the fog.

Built on a mesa of rock standing free in the ocean lies Castle Morne, a keep as formidably built as the walls of Morning. Down below at the bottom of the gorge lies the harbors and you now see the intricate systems of cranes and pulleys designed to supply the city from incoming ships. All of it bathed in the orange rays of sunset.

"_Don't gawk,_" Titania mutters, yanking on your lead. You walk past a cart full of foodstuffs, being pulled by a pair of strong chimera.

Out from the battlements on the castle above come four other chimera, these _winged_ and _flying._ You start to understand why Titania --- formidable though she appears to you --- is considered less than adequate here.

"Halt!" one of the say. They're all armed with red bows, and their arrows fletched with enormous feathers. "What do you come to the castle for?"

"I need to talk to the boss. I caught a spy. I want a reward."

The four of them exchange glances. Clearly this is not procedure. One of them shrugs. "I don't see why not."

They lead you to the open gate, past some others milling about with halberds and axes, putting on some kind of show of force. The four fliers that escorted you leap off the bridge to fly.

"Where's the boss?!" Titania calls out to the guards.

"Main hall."

The keep has only a very small courtyard, where you see a group of humans being driven to work on a treadmill crane by a chimera with a whip, hoisting stone up to the battlements, perhaps to repair some damage.

The main hall, some kind of throne room, is a great big group of chimera, all surrounding a central figure.

A very large, tailed individual with a vibrant red mane. You wager it's a male, judging from his loincloth. He lounges on the toppled throne, surrounded by foodstuffs and smaller chimera --- likely females. Humans in tattered robes tend to his needs and those of his harem. Decadence.

"I _thought_ it might be you!" Titania yells at the sight.

The leader sits up. "Fucking hell, Scab? _Sis?!_"

"What the _fuck_ do you think you're doing, Red!"

He gets up and leaps down from the dais, walking on his knuckles. "What does it look like?! Enjoying the spoils of victory!"

Titania growls. "And so what, you're killing and enslaving everyone? Got your thugs roaming the streets threatening little ones like me?"

He sits down, and laughs. "Oh, sis, you were always so clever, but always so foolish. What do you want me to do? Tell the strong not to use their strength? Let the slavers go?"

"Yes and yes. You've won. No need to be cruel."

Red looks at you. "And what's with this one? You're some hypocrite if you bring in your own slave."

Titania undoes the rope around your neck. "This is Ezekiel. She's a friend."

"A _friend?_ A human is your _friend?!_ Scab, you know as well as I do that humans can't understand---"

"I ran away! Do you know why? Because, yeah, being a slave was bad, but it was _way worse_ to be the runt of the litter! And I come back, hearing you fucking made it, and what do I see? The same shit as always: the big ones bullying the small ones."

"Humans are worse."

"_Then it's our lot to be better!_" Titania yells.

Red snarls. "Scab, you're outta line."

"Titania."

"What?"

"My name isn't Scab. I'm not a youngling anymore."

Red scoffs. "I'm not gonna call you by your fucking _slave name._"

"My name is Titania."

"That's a human name."

"Yeah. Ezekiel gave me that name." She unslings your father's sword and hands it back to you, then the same with your dagger. "She also gave me a horse, a sword, and a purpose."

Red looks menacingly at you. He's roughly the size of an ox. "What?"

"I'm Tarnished," you say. "I seek the Elden Ring, to become Elden Lord. Once I do, I will abolish slavery and free the downtrodden --- chimera among them. Titania is my knight, I would die for her and she would do the same for mer."

"One soul, one will," Titania says.
 
Red laughs darkly, turning to head back to his throne. "No... Sis: you can stay and walk about freely. That human of yours goes in the dungeon --- but only because you like it."

-----

The dungeon is deep, cut out of the rock itself, and full of filth. The smell of death assaults you in the dark, as you're led by candle-light to a cell and thrown in.

Your eyes adjust to the darkness --- there's ventilation shafts here and there giving the barest amount of light. Across from you behind the iron bars of another cell, sits a man in armor.

"Hey," you say.

"There's a kind of face I've not seen before," he says. "What's a Tarnished to do sneaking into Castle Morne during this uprising?"

"Good question. I'm Jester. What's your name, ser?"

"Edgar, once I was knight commander of the guard here, appointed Lord of Godrick himself... But you can see how things have turned out."

You refrain from taking a seat due to the filth on the floor. "What happened here?"

"The menials of the castle have all rebelled. Then they spread the flames to their kin in the city and docks, too. They gave us good service, so I thought. Seems it was all an act --- misbegotten are foul creatures through-and-though. Whatever you've come here to do, you've come in vain. Castle Morne has fallen."

"And they haven't just killed you?"

"They thought it funny to leave me to waste away in a cell for eternity."

You nod and look up and down the corridor of cells. Then you take off the locket Irina gave you and with careful aim throws it into Edgar's cell.

"I met a young woman in the road, on my way here. Irina is her name. She asked me to find you, and tell you to come back to her."

He picks up the locket. "Ah." He laughs darkly. "Were it even possible for me to escape, I must remain. To ensure the holy blade of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands."

"It already has," you say, even if you don't know truly. "They have taken over everything. Wherever that sacred blade is, they've surely already defiled it or thrown it in the sea."

"Still, I must."

"Your daughter is blind and sitting by the roadside waiting for you. How about _I_ go look for that damn sword, and you go take care of your bloodline?"

He stands and comes to the bars of his own cell. "And how do you imagine _that_ is going to happen?"

"Wait and see."

You find a mostly clean spot in the cell to sit and close your eyes.

Fire. Buildings set ablaze. People killed in the streets.

Fire. The red hair of Titania and her brother billowing in the wind.

Your Titania has shed her cloak and shirt, showing the nubby wing stubs on her back, and feathery fur on arms and chest. She wields the bloodhound knight's arms and his speed, in addition to the strength from runes.

Red holds a colossal blade of rough make, and wears but a loincloth, confident in his strength and speed alone.

They clash.

The door at the end of the hallway opens, and you hear Titania's footsteps. She comes to your cell and unlocks it, letting you out. She hands you your father's sword, and your dagger.

"That one also," you say, pointing to Edgar. "That's Irina's father."

"Who is this?" he asks.

"Our way out of here," you say.

"And also the new bosslady," Titania says. She unlocks his cell. "I hope you appreciate your freedom, ser Edgar, because I had to kill my own brother for it. Come with."

You head out of the dungeon together, up the stairs, and into the tiny courtyard. It is morning. Titania points out a chimera guard, wearing a red sash. "You!"

He comes hopping over.

"See this knight to the gates and send him on his way, _unharmed._"

"Wait," Edgar says. "I must find the holy blade of Morne first."

Titania turns to him, pointing at and looming over him. "Listen here, armor boy! I've heard what the Knights of Morne were up to, and I am my bother's sister, so letting you go unharmed is a _mercy!_"

Edger doesn't flinch.

"The Sword of Morne has been thrown in the bay, because it was an ugly piece of rust and of no use to anyone. Jester made a promise to your daughter to see you back to her. Now either you go to her, or I will have you torn limb from limb. _Understand?!_" She yells the last word with enough force to throw spittle in Edgar's face.

You step between them. "Nameless. Enough."

Titania turns away.

"What in all the lands---" Edgar says.

The guardsman growls, hand on the hilt of his axe. "Move it, knight."

Part of you wants to walk him over the bridge and explain things.

But all the rest of you runs after Titania.

-----

It is a good long while before the two of you have time together, alone. Titania walks about, barking orders, bringing her brother's inner circle to heel with threats and violence, and you feel her falling deeper in grief with every word.
