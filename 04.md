# A Face not Seen before

Through the dark, Titania's hand gives you comfort. The tunnel stinks of clay.

"How much longer?"

"Not far."

The tunnel opens somewhat and Titania stops. "Ladder, here." She puts your hand on the post of the ladder, and swings herself up past you. You climb up, having to look down to not have sand fall in your eyes from her feet.

And then she stops. "Trap door." She grunts with exertion. "They've blocked it."

"Do we go back?"

"Let me just..." She grunts louder and you hear the ladder creak. Then a crack of light above nearly blinds you. Titania shoves the claws of her gauntlet through to keep it open and repositions to brace against the wall.

With a mighty heave and the smashing and crashing of things falling over, Titania emerges into the rooms above.

She reaches down and pulls you up with ease. Whatever Melina did to her, Titania is now terrifyingly strong.

"So what now?" you ask.

Titania unwraps the scarf around her head and takes off her hat, revealing knotted and dirty deep red hair. "From here on out, I'm the one in charge --- do you have any rope?"

You don't. You should have purchased some from Kal√© or the other merchant. But you are in a store room. "Let's look for some."

In one of the boxes you do indeed find rope, and Titania reveals her plan. "I know it sounds bad, but we'll have to pretend you're my prisoner. Give me your weapons, and tie this around your neck."

"Okay."

"Okay? You don't have any objections?"

"You're my Shadow."

She slings your father's sword on her back, and takes your dagger in her belt, then she takes the rope in hand, as if you're an animal on a lead.

Then you head into the street.

Above stretches buildings tall and strangely built, with streets on multiple levels.

"Morne is built in a gorge," Titania explains. "The harbor is at the bottom. This way."

The streets are lined with crucifixes with mummified remains strung up, and misbegotten walk about the streets --- seeming for all in the world like ordinary people. They wear clothes in the form of skirts and cloaks, and some of them carry great big cleavers. Some of them look your way, sure, but Titania is recognizably one of theirs, and visibly armed.

Titania steers you down into the gorge, where daylight becomes scarce, down steps and sloping streets until, and then upwards again.
