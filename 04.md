# A Face not Seen before

Through the dark, Titania's hand gives you comfort. The tunnel stinks of clay.

"How much longer?"

"Not far."

The tunnel opens somewhat and Titania stops. "Ladder, here." She puts your hand on the post of the ladder, and swings herself up past you. You climb up, having to look down to not have sand fall in your eyes from her feet.

And then she stops. "Trap door." She grunts with exertion. "They've blocked it."

"Do we go back?"

"Let me just..." She grunts louder and you hear the ladder creak. Then a crack of light above nearly blinds you. Titania shoves the claws of her gauntlet through to keep it open and repositions to brace against the wall.

With a mighty heave and the smashing and crashing of things falling over, Titania emerges into the rooms above.

She reaches down and pulls you up with ease. Whatever Melina did to her, Titania is now terrifyingly strong.

"So what now?" you ask.

Titania unwraps the scarf around her head and takes off her hat, revealing knotted and dirty deep red hair. "From here on out, I'm the one in charge --- do you have any rope?"

You don't. You should have purchased some from Kal√© or the other merchant. But you are in a store room. "Let's look for some."

In one of the boxes you do indeed find rope, and Titania reveals her plan. "I know it sounds bad, but we'll have to pretend you're my prisoner. Give me your weapons, and tie this around your neck."

"Okay."

"Okay? You don't have any objections?"

"You're my Shadow."

She slings your father's sword on her back, and takes your dagger in her belt, then she takes the rope in hand, as if you're an animal on a lead. With your dagger she cuts off a length of the rope to tie your hands behind your back.

Then you head into the street.

Above stretches buildings tall and strangely built, with streets on multiple levels.

"Morning is built in a gorge," Titania explains. "The harbor is at the bottom. This way."

The streets are lined with crucifixes with mummified remains strung up, and chimeras walk about the streets --- seeming for all in the world like ordinary people. They wear clothes in the form of skirts and cloaks, and some of them carry great big cleavers. Some of them look your way, sure, but Titania is recognizably one of theirs, and visibly armed.

As you walk down one of the narrow streets, a group of three stops you. Their hair is white, and one of them has some kind of growth on her face, while the other two have tails. All three of them are armed, and they are all somewhat bigger than Titania.

"Ey, what have we here?"

"None of your business," Titania says.

"Human on a leash? Seems like our business," another says.

"I'm going to the castle to present this one ---" Titania tugs on your lead, and you stumble on purpose "--- to the boss. Found her snooping around. Says she's one of King Godrick's, and they're planning a huge siege."

The three look at each other. "Why don't we do that for you? A scrawny little female like yourself shouldn't be out and about hunting down spies."

"I can beat up all of you, so why don't you scram?"

One of them swings at Titania, and she ducks under and lays an uppercut at his chin hard enough that you hear bone breaking. He staggers back and nearly falls over the railing onto the roof of a building below.

Titania shakes her hand. "Either of you two fool enough to make me draw a blade?" she growls.

They grab their buddy and hobble off.

You head further down into the gorge, where daylight becomes scarce, down steps and sloping streets, and then upwards again, to a great big bridge, stretching into the fog --- only as you set foot on the bridge, a strong gust clears the fog.

Built on a mesa of rock standing free in the ocean lies Castle Morne, a keep as formidably built as the walls of Morning. Down below at the bottom of the gorge lies the harbors and you now see the intricate systems of cranes and pulleys designed to supply the city from incoming ships. All of it bathed in the orange rays of sunset.

"_Don't gawk,_" Titania mutters, yanking on your lead. You walk past a cart full of foodstuffs, being pulled by a pair of strong chimera.

Out from the battlements on the castle above come four other chimera, these _winged_ and _flying._ You start to understand why Titania --- formidable though she appears to you --- is considered less than adequate here. No tail, no wings, no horns, no claws.

"Halt!" one of the say. They're all armed with red bows, and their arrows fletched with enormous feathers. "What do you come to the castle for?"

"I need to talk to the boss. I caught a spy. I want a reward."

The four of them exchange glances. Clearly this is not procedure. One of them shrugs. "I don't see why not."

They lead you to the open gate, past some others milling about with halberds and axes, putting on some kind of show of force. The four fliers that escorted you leap off the bridge to fly.

"Where's the boss?!" Titania calls out to the guards.

"Main hall."

The keep has only a very small courtyard, where you see a group of humans being driven to work on a treadmill crane by a chimera with a whip, hoisting stone up to the battlements, perhaps to repair some damage.

In the main hall, some kind of throne room, is a great big group of chimera, all surrounding a central figure.

A very large, tailed individual with a vibrant red mane. You wager it's a male, judging from his loincloth. He lounges on the toppled throne, surrounded by foodstuffs and smaller chimera --- likely females. Humans in tattered robes tend to his needs and those of his harem. Decadence.

"I _thought_ it might be you!" Titania yells at the sight.

The leader sits up. "Fucking hell, Scab? _Sis?!_"

"What the _fuck_ do you think you're doing, Red!"

He gets up and leaps down from the dais, walking on his knuckles. "What does it look like?! Enjoying the spoils of victory!"

Titania growls. "And so what, you're killing and enslaving everyone? Got your thugs roaming the streets threatening little ones like me?"

He sits down, and laughs. "Oh, sis, you were always so clever, but always so foolish. What do you want me to do? Tell the strong not to use their strength? Let the slavers go?"

"Yes and yes. You've won. No need to be cruel."

Red looks at you. "And what's with this one? You're some hypocrite if you bring in your own slave."

Titania undoes the rope around your neck, and untie your hands. "This is Ezekiel. She's a friend."

"A _friend?_ A human is your _friend?!_ Scab, you know as well as I do that humans can't understand---"

"I ran away! Do you know why? Because, yeah, being a slave was bad, but it was _way worse_ to be the runt of the litter! And I come back, hearing you fucking made it, and what do I see? The same shit as always: the big ones bullying the small ones."

"Humans are worse."

"_Then it's our lot to be better!_" Titania yells.

Red snarls. "Scab, you're outta line."

"Titania."

"What?"

"My name isn't Scab. I'm not a youngling anymore."

Red scoffs. "I'm not gonna call you by your fucking _slave name._"

"My name is Titania."

"That's a human name."

"Yeah. Ezekiel gave me that name." She unslings your father's sword and hands it back to you, then the same with your dagger. "She also gave me a horse, a sword, and a purpose."

Red looks menacingly at you. He's roughly the size of an ox. "What?"

"I'm Tarnished," you say. "I seek the Elden Ring, to become Elden Lord. Once I do, I will abolish slavery and free the downtrodden --- chimera among them. Titania is my knight, I would die for her and she would do the same for me."

"One soul, one will," Titania says.
 
Red laughs darkly, turning to head back to his throne. "No... Sis: you can stay and walk about freely. That human of yours goes in the dungeon --- but only because you like it."

-----

The dungeon is deep, cut out of the rock itself, and full of filth. The smell of death assaults you in the dark, as you're led by candle-light to a cell and thrown in.

Your eyes adjust to the darkness --- there's ventilation shafts here and there giving the barest amount of light. Across from you behind the iron bars of another cell, sits a man in armor.

"Hey," you say.

"There's a kind of face I've not seen before," he says. "What's a Tarnished to do sneaking into Castle Morne during this uprising?"

"Good question. I'm Jester. What's your name, ser?"

"Edgar, once I was knight commander of the guard here, appointed a Lord of Morne by King Godrick himself... But you can see how things have turned out."

You refrain from taking a seat due to the filth on the floor. "What happened here?"

"The menials of the castle have all rebelled. Then they spread the flames to their kin in the city and docks, too. They gave us good service, so I thought. Seems it was all an act --- misbegotten are foul creatures through-and-though. Whatever you've come here to do, you've come in vain. Castle Morne has fallen."

"And they haven't just killed you?"

"They thought it funny to leave me to waste away in a cell for eternity."

You nod and look up and down the corridor of cells. Then you take off the locket Irina gave you and with careful aim throws it into Edgar's cell.

"I met a young woman in the road, on my way here. Irina is her name. She asked me to find you, and tell you to come back to her."

He picks up the locket. "Ah." He laughs darkly. "Were it even possible for me to escape, I must remain. To ensure the holy blade of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands."

"It already has," you say, even if you don't know truly. "They have taken over everything. Wherever that sacred blade is, they've surely already defiled it or thrown it in the sea."

"Still, I must."

"Your daughter is blind and sitting by the roadside waiting for you. How about _I_ go look for that damn sword, and you go take care of your bloodline?"

He stands and comes to the bars of his own cell. "And how do you imagine _that_ is going to happen?"

"Wait and see."

You find a mostly clean spot in the cell to sit and close your eyes.

-----

```{=html}
<div align=right>
```

Fire. Buildings set ablaze. People killed in the streets.

Fire. The red hair of Titania and her brother billowing in the wind.

Your Titania has shed her cloak and shirt, showing the nubby wing stubs on her back, and feathery fur on arms and chest. She wields the bloodhound knight's arms and his speed, in addition to the strength from runes.

Red holds a colossal blade of rough make, and wears but a loincloth, confident in his strength and speed alone.

They clash.

```{=html}
</div>
```

-----

The door at the end of the hallway opens, and you hear Titania's footsteps. She comes to your cell and unlocks it, letting you out. She hands you your father's sword, and your dagger.

"That one also," you say, pointing to Edgar. "That's Irina's father."

"Who is this?" he asks.

"Our way out of here," you say.

"And also the new bosslady," Titania says. She unlocks his cell. "I hope you appreciate your freedom, ser Edgar, because I had to kill my own brother for it. Come with."

You head out of the dungeon together, up the stairs, and into the tiny courtyard. It is morning. Titania points out a chimera guard, wearing a red sash. "You!"

He comes hopping over.

"See this knight to the gates and send him on his way, _unharmed._"

"Wait," Edgar says. "I _must_ find the holy blade of Morne first."

Titania turns to him, pointing at and looming over him. "Listen here, knight! I've heard what the Knights of Morne were up to, and I am my bother's sister, so letting you go unharmed is a _mercy!_"

Edger doesn't flinch.

"The Sword of Morne has been thrown in the bay, because it was an ugly piece of rust and of no use to anyone. Jester made a promise to your daughter to see you back to her. Now either you go to her, or I will have you torn limb from limb. _Understand?!_" She yells the last word with enough force to throw spittle in Edgar's face.

You step between them. "Nameless. Enough."

Titania turns away.

"What in all the lands---" Edgar says.

The guardsman growls, hand on the hilt of his axe. "Move it, knight."

Part of you wants to walk him over the bridge and explain things.

But all the rest of you runs after Titania. "Find your daughter!" you yell back after him.

-----

It is a good long while before the two of you have time together, alone. Titania walks about, barking orders, bringing her brother's inner circle to heel with threats and violence, and you feel her falling deeper in grief with every word.

You follow behind her best as you can, playing the part of loyal servant, drawn sword resting on your shoulder just to convince any onlookers not to have quarrel with you --- Titania had to snarl at someone who laid hands on you.

And then a moment of stillness comes, when everyone has been told off, what to do, and who is in charge. You slow down in a hallway of the upper level of the castle. She leans on the wall and you sheathe your sword. Without a word you go and give her a hug.

She puts her arms around you and sink down to sit, holding onto you like you're her only connection to the world --- because you might as well be, in some sense.

"He wouldn't yield," she mutters. "I gave him a surrender. He refused mercy."

You shush her and stroke her head.

"I... I killed him. He was my brother. I killed him."

"This land is cursed," you say.

You notice a patch of dampness on her shirt, so dark with grime and discoloration you don't realize it is blood at a glance. "You're hurt?"

She shakes her head and hands you back the bauble of healing draught. "I helped myself."

"Let me help you now, then."

You get up to stand, and help her up as well. With some questions to the staff --- chimeras all --- who took care of the castle before as now, you find your way to the laundry and the baths. An aqueduct as part of the bridge provides the water for the whole castle and is tapped here.

Titania sits by while you drain one of the stone tubs that has been left stagnant, and rinse and scrub out the grime, then fill it with fresh cold water. You relieve her of her clothes --- trousers and shirt of sizes you cannot imagine, and a sash half again as long as you are tall.

"Can you please see if you can fetch the bosslady some clean clothes?" you ask one of the laundresses. She has been regarding you take care of Titania at a distance, clearly understanding that the two of you share a bond.

Then Titania climbs into the tub, and you acquire soap and a coarse brush with which she can clean herself, and a comb to go to work on her hair. It takes a small eternity to get her clean of layers and layers of grime, and get her hair smooth and shiny. The laundress returns with a clean doublet that fits Titania, and a pair of sturdy canvas trousers, bound with a belt of real leather.

You run a whetstone over Titania's curved greatsword and clawed gauntlet and give both some blade oil.

And thus, cleaned, dressed, and armed, Titania stands, looking leagues better than she was.

"Better now?"

"Much better."

She kneels to hug you long and soft.

"When your mane is dry, I'll braid it."

------

You stay in Morning for nine days. Titania asserts her position as the Lord of Morne by right of conquest, and conditions the chimeras of the city to respect her. As they live in Morning, Chimera understand best the power that comes from strength.

The humans kept in slavery are set free to go, and Titania appoints a council to rule in her absence and cautioning them that she could return any time.

This you of course take as necessity to learn how to travel by Grace.

Searching the city for it, you find a mote of light in a church, underneath a defaced statue of Queen Marika --- or so you surmise those statues depict. The pews have been broken and removed, perhaps to be used for firewood. There's a hole in the roof where water has dripped through and waterlogged the boards underfoot.

There is no devotion in your heart for whomever this Queen Marika is, but if this is going to be how you and Titania travel to and fro, it would be strange to leave it in such a state. You spend a while gathering the broken wood, sweeping the floors, and wondering if anything can be done about the roof. The sun is out and the weather, warm. You have girdled up your loins and tied up your sleeves to work. Your hair hangs free in braid, and you wear but a light veil.

"Ezekiel."

You turn to the Grace. Melina is standing there.

"Melina."

"How fare thee?"

"Titania has become the Lord of Morne."

"I see. Congratulations."

You shake your head. "She had to kill her own brother for the throne."

"So... you will be staying in Morne?"

"That is not the plan, no. I will be teaching myself to travel by Grace, and to bring along my Shadow. Thus we can travel the land and occasionally return here, for her to govern."

Melina nods. "Good." She wrings her hands. "Forgive me; I've been testing you, to see whether or not Grace truly does guide you. To see whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails."

You lean on your broom. "And your verdict?"

"It seems my worries were unfounded. Torrent had your measure from the very start. Whereas I merely pretended."

"You had faith, then."

"There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance. I can show you to the Roundtable Hold. 'Tis a gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace."

You step closer to her. "I cannot go just yet."

"No need. It is situated outside of the world's influence. The only way to access it is traveling through Grace; you need an invitation. Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment."

She puts her fingers on your forehead and you receive a brief vision of a vast golden shard of light among the arms of great warriors.

Melina withdraws her hand and you seize courage to take her hand in yours, and put her knuckles to your lips --- even if only through your veil.

"Titania will have runes for you," you say. "I shall summon you soon."

"I will come as called."

Melina fades into ash even as you hold her hand.

-----

It takes you two days of contemplation in the chapel to discover how it is done. Titania visits you one of these days for Melina to strengthen her yet again.

The trick of the light is the key to step through the shard of Grace, like passing through the eye of a needle.

Your first order of business is to emerge from thin air at the small lake between the trees further north on the Weeping Insula, and you whistle for Torrent, riding into the afternoon, heading north at a steady pace, up past the farmlands and through the narrow mountain pass.

There you find a battle has taken place. Skewered corpses of chimera, ballista bolts being dug up by soldiers to be re-sharpened and loaded back into the machines. Can't have been more than a day.

And at the edge of the battlefield, by the side of the road, you recognize a figure: Edgar.

Crouched over something.

As you approach you see what.

His daughter. Irina.

Decapitated.

You stomach sinks, and you approach him. He notices you.

"We meet again, Jester."

"I'm sorry for your loss."

"My daughter deserved better. The fault lies with me. I chose duty over my daughter's safety, and that is how fate has answered..."

"The chimera known as Red, who led the rebellion, he is dead. Titania is working tirelessly to create order among her kin and rein in these war bands like the one that attacked here. She did not die in vain."

He stands up, gripping his halberd tight.

"Those foul wretches responsible for this. I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them."

You hold out a hand towards him. "Now, stay your anger, ser Edgar. Look around you: those responsible already met their end at the hands of the garrison at the bridge."

Edgar glares at you. "You're with them. You're a lackey of the misbegotten rebels --- I should strike you down."

"We both know that will not bring Irina back. Go see to it your daughter has proper burial rites, grieve for her as she deserves, and think on whether she would want your life to be consumed by vengeance."

He lowers his halberd. "Queen Marika forgive me."

You leave him with his grief, following the guidance of Grace.

Returning to the church in Morning, you head back to the castle to deliver the bad news. Titania will want to know that a war band was destroyed, and... perhaps comfort you that you failed to see Irina and Edgar united in this life. She was such a pretty girl.

-----

Stepping through Grace brings you back to the church ruin where you first met Kal√©, and there you find him about to saddle up --- so it looks. His mule has laid down, and he has fallen over. A mist hangs over the ground.

"Kal√©?"

"This way, Tarnished. May I have a word?"

You turn to the voice and behold a strange sight: a woman in a great pointed hat and a white robe. Her skin is blue, the same color as the twilight. Approaching you notice more things: she has four hands, and her right eye is closed --- a second, ghostly image of her face shares that eye... it is difficult to describe, much less look at.

She is eerily beautiful. Not as a woman you would ever desire, but like the starry sky on a clear night, or the cerulean sea, or the crescent moon.

"Speak forth."

"A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished. I am the witch Renna; I've heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed---"

"From whom? And please, call me Jester. Tarnished is such an ugly word."

"Very well. I surmise this talk is of thee, then, Jester?"

"I would still very much like to know from whom you have heard. I've been doing most of my 'hurtling about' on Torrent three days south from here in the Weeping Insula."

"Thou art inquisitive---"

"I also get told I am sharp of wit."

She pauses. "I would prefer thou not interrupt me. 'Tis rude."

"Thousand pardons, Lady Renna --- if that is indeed thine true name. 'Tis my nature."

"Apologies accepted, Jester, if that be thine."

"'Tis not. Shall we make a trade? I tell mine, thou tellest thine?"

"I came to deliver thee an heirloom, not play word games with a jester."

"And I came to purchase fine goods from Kal√©, not play word games with a witch. You make it too easy, Lady Renna."

"Quite the stubborn one, aren't we? Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty --- perhaps thine ample mistrust will be thy benefit."

"I am only as mistrustful as you, milady. Stubbornness afflicts us both. You will find me quite trusting for but a small show of confidence. From whom did you hear that I rode Torrent? Melina? Blaidd?"

"Melina is with you, is she? That meddler."

You come upon a wild guess. "Would you by chance be Blaidd's mysterious mistress, whom even Melina will not tell me the name of?"

"Thou art astute, Jester. Blaidd is my servant."

"Then you also know my true name already; you've had me at a disadvantage this whole time. That's rude."

"Ezekiel."

You take a deep bow. "As I stand before you. A humble Tarnished, member of the Roundtable Hold."

Renna reaches inside her robe and draws out a silver bell. "I was entrusted this, for thee, by Torrent's former master. 'Tis a bell for calling forth spirits. Summons them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree."

You look at the bell but do not reach out to take it. "It is a beautiful craftsmanship. Who was Torrent's former master, if I may?"

"A man named Vyke. He is long vanished from the world." She spins it in her palm, holding the handle towards you.

You note to yourself that 'vanished' and 'dead' is not the same.

"Hm," you say. "I am loath to accept charity from my betters... perhaps this could be a gift from a peer who knows my name and I know theirs?"

"I suppose there be no harm in that. Renna was my teacher --- I often go by her name. I am Ranni. Now I bid thee to take this bell before I drop it in the mud."

You take it from her. It is heavy. "Lady Ranni, thou art a kind lady. I must think thee of many friends, and I would be so lucky as to count myself among them, could I win thy friendship."

"I shall remember thee, Ezekiel. Perhaps we shall again meet, perhaps not; but all the same, learn well the Lands Between." She looks aside. "How long, I wonder... before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers."

"I should think I have no obeisance save to mine own convictions."




<!-- he and Blaidd together, saddling up to leave.

"Thousand pardons," you say. "Am I interrupting?"

"Not in the slightest," Blaidd says. "Jester, was it?"

"Indeed, Kal√©, I had just hoped to catch you --- recall that set of tools and manuals?"

"Of course!" He digs through the saddlebag of his mule and presents you with a leather bundle, a wooden box, and a heavy tome.

You take out a heavy glob of runes to pay him --- he breaks it in half with his fingers to give you change back. A whistle brings Torrent to your side and you stow the goods.

"Ser Blaidd," you say. "Do you get much use out of that shield you pilfered?"

"I did already a few days ago, but I suspect It'll be dead weight for a good long while on my way north."

"Might I not buy it off you? I have a strong friend who could use it, I think. Fancy selling it?"

Blaidd chuckles. "A friend?" -->
