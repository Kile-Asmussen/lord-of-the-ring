
# A Lowly Tarnished of No Renown

It feels like mind returns to you as you near the Lands Between. Like waking from a dream. A fever dream of fog and pain.

Your travel companions, just as addled by the timeless eternity spent on the long march, pull hoods around their faces to keep the pale fog at bay.

The captain shouts. You know not what. The winds fill the sail. Your white-knuckled grip on the steering oar slips not one inch.

Somewhere ahead, it calls to you. A whispering promise of salvation. Like water calling to a thirsting woman. You're so very thirsty.

The ship makes the shore, the anchor stone is thrown overboard. Down the coast in the very far distance, you think you see figures wandering out into the waves.

The captain says something. You tie the steering oar down and grab your kit. You sling the scabbard with your father's heavy sword, check your dagger on your belt, pack your knapsack with empty waterskin and breadbag, kiss your rosary, and hop overboard into the thigh-deep icy surf.

Someone complains. Someone else complains about the first one complaining.

And then you're on dry land, wet boots in moist sand, and from somewhere above, a tiny mote of light slowly floats down. You reach out and it seems drawn to your palm, where it fizzles out like an ember.

You look up the sheer cliff wondering where it might have come from. The sky has an eerie glow which does not come from the sun. In the cliff, stairs have been carved.

"All right!" the captain yells. "Let's go! Up the stairs! Water and food! We need to find water and food!"

"Why the fuck do we have to take orders from you?!" someone else yells.

You stay quiet. Your eyes itch but your gloves and fingers are full of salt, so you refrain from rubbing them.

"Because I'm the damn captain, kid!"

"Fuck you, I'm going down the beach, I ain't climbing a hundred fathoms of stairs!"

You look on as some of your fellow crew set off down the beach. You say a quiet prayer for them.

"Hey! Ezekiel, don't space out," the Captain says.

"Sorry, sir," you mutter, voice muffled by the scarf around your head.

And then you head for the cliff with the other six. The captain leads on with his old, scuffed armor, long curved sword at one hip, and strung bow in hand. He hails form the land of reeds. Taking the rear is the wanderer with his armor, and shield.

You walk with a holyman in rags, a criminal with an iron mask, a scholar in fine robes. Others. Somewhere in the distant past out in the fog, you must have boarded a ship together. You do not remember.

You glance down, from on high, at the beach below. There walks a tall figure dragging a heavy blade; heading for the stairs to follow you up.

"We're being followed," the wanderer says.

"Make haste," the captain replies.

You do. Up and up. To the top of the cliff with a narrow landing, with a great gate ajar.

"Inside!"

The wanderer holds it open for you. The figure following you steps onto the landing with you. A gaunt thing. He dashes forward and conjures wave of energy which flings the wanderer to him to meet the monster's blade.

"Shut the door!" the captain yells.

You all push; it closes with a low thud; the captain bars it.

"Fuck," the prisoner says.

"We've been ashore for score moments and already one of us is dead," someone else says. An evil woman with wicked knives in her belt and a black shawl over her mouth.

"Maybe more," you point out.

The space inside is a chapel. Icons plaster the walls, statues line them, mummified remains rest against. All of it dedicated to some woman, you vaguely remember your father telling you about when you were a girl.

"We venture in," the captain says. "If that thing comes back..."

So you head further into the chapel, and in a chamber to the side is a raised basin of clear water. But not much.

The evil woman shoves aside a young man to get to the basin and drink, the man who would perhaps one day become a great champion lashes out at her. She draws her wicked knife and disembowels him, he wears no doublet that might turn away a blade, just his bare belly and a breastband.

The blood splatters in the water.

"Stay back!" the evil woman yells, whipping her knife to and fro. "I'll drink my fill, and then you can have yours!"

An arrow hits her in the chest. She falls down, dead, landing in the water, spoiling it for all.

"There will be more water, later," says the captain. "And never drink still water."

You silently wish the two dead well in the hereafter, if there is one.

One by one this land claims lives.

"This land is cursed," you mutter to your captain.

"Don't be stupid."

The prisoner with the iron mask stumbles on a bolt of cloth and hits his head hard enough that he cannot stand up straight anymore. He requests time to rest and you leave him behind. The holyman passes a statue of that woman and stays to pray.

And with only the captain left, you reach a courtyard. There, on the other end of it, is a golden shard of light, hovering just over the ground.

You don't ask what it is. It draws you in. This is what you're here for. You want it.

You need it. To touch it, to savor it, to rest.

Then you hear a blade leave the scabbard.

You don't look, you merely duck, and the horizontal swing of your captain's blade goes over your head. You roll aside and draw your greatsword, but your captain moves between you and the Grace.

Yes, that is what it is, Grace.

"It's mine," he says.

Anger and madness bubbles in you and you scream incoherently, running at him. He swings, and you leap aside, springing up half your height and kicking him in the face. You trade blows, your strength and heavier blade overwhelm him, and you break his guard, putting a mighty chop to his sword arm and following up with a mighty cut at his legs.

He falls.

"Curse you," he mutters. You draw your dagger and finish him off.

Then as his lifeblood runs onto the sandy ground you turn to claim your prize.

But as soon as the breeze from your movements reaches the Grace, it fades. And with it the sense of want. It was false. This land is cursed.

You hear a faint scream; the holyman. And then you run for the rickety bridge, to an open door beyond which lies the same fog you have sailed through for unnamed eternities and you nearly despair as your run through it.

Beyond the gate the fog quickly clears in a squall.

An open space, a great big statue like the one the holyman prayed at. One side, an empty cliff into the void.

Doom descends from the sky. A great silhouette leaps from the roof of the chapel, landing before you. A horror beyond horror --- you haven't the words. Hands and arms, too many, swords and shields twin.

Still armed, you decide in the moment to make up for the sin of killing your captain for a trick of the light, and die like a warrior.

You dodge one thrust only to be impaled on the other sword.

----

You heave and gasp for breath and get a mouthful of dirty puddle-water through your mouth-covering. You cough and sputter, pushing yourself up, hands rushing to feel your chest for the bane wound. Merely a hole in your doublet and vest.

Nothing. You scramble up against the wall, in a cave, having laid face down in a puddle. You may very well have drowned in the least dignified way possible had you not returned to your senses.

"Fortune is on your side, Tarnished warrior."

That word is one you have not heard in a long time. An ugly word; were the hairs on the nape of your neck not stuck in cakes of grime, they would stand on end.

You look to the speaker, a cloaked woman, atop a steed with the manners of a horse but the horns of a goat or elk. Her voice is beautiful, so is the curve of her chin, visible under the hood.

"Don't call me that," you mutter, and stand.

"Do you seek the Elden Ring?"

You shake your head, slowly. "I know not what that is."

"Pity."

She reaches under her cloak, and pulls out a bauble of gold and for a moment you fear it something untoward. She tosses it to you and you catch it.

"In case you change your mind, this might help you. A restorative medicine."

Then she pulls on the reins and the horse leaps into the darkness of the cave.

Getting up makes all of your bones protest, but you stagger after in the dark, and see faint light illuminating the stone from beyond a bend ahead.

And there you see it, the same trick of the light, the same irresistible glow. Another figure is in the cave with you, something emancipated and armed, clawing on the wall. It sees you not, but you draw your dagger and creep close, until your shadow is cast on the very wall it examines.

You impale it, cutting sideways as your father showed you, to sever the spine. It twitches and slumps over backwards, forcing you you throw it aside.

And now the golden glow is all yours. Well-remembering what happened before, you approach with caution and against wisdom. But you must.

So you reach out and touch Grace, and it _sings_ to you. Warmth, safety. Home. Why this mote of golden light recalls to you an open hearth in your childhood house, you know not.

But sit you do, to rest your weary joints for a long spell, feeling no hunger or thirst.

Then you get up, despite the comfort. Somewhere out there is perhaps a Grace in fairer surroundings, and in any case you need to leave this cave. That you're certain of.

It is dark, and part of you wishes desperately you could somehow bring the golden Grace with you to light your way, but alas it is not a substance for mortal hands to grasp. Yet you try, futilely and your hand comes away with but a wisp of it that falls through your fingers like smoke.

But from it comes a little trail of glittering gold, flowing further into the dark, lighting the way as it were.

Dagger in hand you push on into the faintly illuminated dimness.

More of the emancipated man-things with dull and broken weapons sit or scurry to and fro; you leave well enough alone and eventually come to a larger cave lit from above perhaps by real sunlight coming down through a shaft.

There's a man there, in mail and helm, with a greatsword. His brigandine is red and green, and he takes a combat stance. So do you, sheathing dagger and drawing your own greatsword.

He closes and lunges, you parrying the strong blow and sweep his leg. He stumbles but regains his footing.

"What quarrel have you with me?" you yell, dancing back.

He opponent stands, sword at the ready, and seems to remember how to speak. "Fuh--- fer--- fordogolorder." Then he screams incoherently and lunges at you, mind gone far more so than yours.

You bash aside his blade with yours and kick him in the chest. He falls and you're on him in a moment, driving your sword into his groin.

He screams in pain, but still manages to return the attack and the tip of his sword hits your side.

You stumble back, fire burning in your flank. This, you reason, must be it. Somehow surviving the monster in the chapel could be a fluke or perhaps just an evil dream. This was a fight fought fair, man against woman, one you have narrowly won many times before, perhaps too many.

Fitting end. Live by the sword, die by it.

You fall on your rear in the foul water, further dirtying yourself. Then you recall the curative in the golden bauble. For want of better options you take it out with shaking hand and bring it to your lips, pulling stopper with your teeth, and hope the beautiful mystery woman is not a charlatan.

The draught is tender on the tongue, trailing gentle fire like a good brandywine, and you know then that this is what she meant. One last mouthful of good drink for a dying warrior.

Hand on your side to stem the bleeding some, you shuffle to the wall of the cave to die with some dignity, so you won't have to wet your hair when you lie down in the puddle. The soldier is bleeding out quickly muddying the water further.

Sitting against the wall and watching him die, you wait for the same.

A moment becomes two, but your strength seems to return, rather than wane.

You poke your wound to find a tender scar rather than a bleeding slit.

Standing is easier now. You inspect your sword --- it'll need time with your whetstone later. Heading onwards you reach a heavy gate illuminated by the guidance of Grace.

Laying all your might into it, you push on the doors and light blinds you. The dawn sun hangs low in the sky shining right upon your face.

Twice. Twice impaled and somehow made hale. Perhaps one day you shall taste death. Today you taste fresh air and behold the beauty of creation.

"Hullo," says a voice to the side and you turn to see a man with a strange white mask, tending to his horse. "Stranger, I am not your enemy; give me but a moment and I'll be on my way."

He pauses. "Ah. Tarnished, are we? Why, not the first I've seen this past moon."

Your hand rests on the pommel of your dagger. You try to speak but you have to clear your throat first. "Who are you?"

"Varre, of the White Masks," he says with a bow. "I mean you no harm, fair warrior."

You take a step back; of course your voice betrays your womanhood. Now you also notice that his shawl is stained in old blood.

"Fear not, I am a chirurgeon --- a healer. Now, far be it from me to presume, but you seem worse for wear. Seeking the Elden Ring is no small task, maidenless as you are."

"So what if I am unmarried?" you answer.

Varre says nothing for a moment then laughs. "Oh, what a funny fool!" he sputters, leaning on his horse.

"I fail to see the mirth."

He holds up a hand. "Pardons, pardons, you know not how humorous your words are to me. No: you have no _finger_ maiden."

"Aye, if I had a maiden of my own you can be sure I'd put my fingers her." A witticism on purpose.

This causes him another peal of laughter. "You jester! Allow me to finish, please, before your japes cause me death by laughter!" He takes a deep breath. "By Grace, do you have a name, jester?"

"Ezekiel."

"Ah, very well. Let me give you this advice: a priestess devoted to the Greater Will, a maiden who reads the gestures of the Two Fingers, a _finger maiden,_ can ease your pain and bolster your strength owing to the Greater Will's power." He mounts up. "Find one. Or the guidance of Grace will lead you to naught but an early grave."

Then he rides off at a trot. "Best of luck, Jester Ezekiel!"

"Wait! Varre of the White Masks," you call out.

He does, turning to you in the saddle.

"You said I was not the first Tarnished you had met this moon. Where have the others gone?"

"To Castle Stormveil up north here in Limgrave."

"Thank you. Godspeed."

"And to you, Tarnished."

----

You to wander, vaguely and in some direction, guided by the wisps of light more than overgrown trails.

No recollection in your mind from these lands; perhaps your birth was elsewhere, but you recall no other home than the draw of Grace.

Limgrave is a land of trees and meadows. The air is fresh and clean which serves only to highlight how dirty you are. The canopies overhead are lush and let the sunlight illuminate your path in gold-green shafts.

Bushes of berries sit ripe and red and you leave well enough alone knowing not what poison they may hold.

In between the trunks labor bears and worse things while game darts about. You wish you had thought to steal your captain's bow. Both to hunt but also to stave off a bear if need be.

Overhead, most ominous of all, dominating the horizon at all times when your path takes you into the open, is _it. A great glowing tree, towering over all the world.

With that unnatural landmark taking up a fourth of the sky, you find a clear, clean stream of water, running quickly over smooth rocks.

And there, by its side, is a hallow of Grace. A glimmering figment of your salvation, a feeling of home.

You sit by it, and relief fills you once more.

Checking about yourself and around the edge of the clearing, you deem it worth the risk and undo your veil, bending down to dink. Deep and long. Your throat is icy when you come up for breath, and you know you must have a bath this instant.

A bath and a round of laundry.

If a bear comes by and kills you so be it; you have braved death many times already.

There's time: the sun is still climbing in the sky and you predict it will be a hot day, so you find a good stick of wood to fashion into a washing paddle with your dagger, and proceed to undress.

You keep your sword close.

Everything not of leather gets a thorough rinse and a walloping against a smooth rock on the shore, and then you wring each with all your might and lay them on the branches of berry bushes nearby.

Your leathers get a gentle rinse and rubbing --- animal fat would be best but this will do.

Last, you wash yourself. Rub down every inch of yourself with calloused hands causing pellets of grime and salt to come off. Wrapping your sash around the washing paddle gets your back clean. Your hair demands a thorough rinse, comb, rinse, and comb again before it feels clean.

The hot sun dries your clothes and hair quickly, even your gambeson doublet, and no voyeurs show to peep on you in any state of undress.

Your hunger feels not as profound as you sit there in the hallow by the site of Grace. As each article of clothing dries, you get dressed --- loincloth, breastband, veil most importantly, rendering you technically decent. You braid your hair, re-tie your headwrap, tie your shirt, bind your breeches and leg wraps, leather skirt and gambeson doublet, arm wraps and gauntlets.

Then as you go to pick up the little bottle of restorative you find it to be heavy with liquid inside, just as when you were first given it. You tie a length of string to it and keep it around your neck.

It doesn't hurt to leave the site of Grace behind, despite how it pulls you in. Perhaps it is foolish to leave, given the lateness of the day, but your hunger demands it.

As evening falls and you continue your way through the forests, you reach a paved road and the end of the light of Grace guiding you.

Absent better, you pick one of the directions and head onwards down the road. It is a pleasant change of pace from hiking cross-country.

You hope it will lead you to a township.

It's not long before you hear the sound of thunderously heavy hoofbeats behind you. Turning to look turns out to be the wrong use of your time as you behold a knight, mounted on a horse larger than you have ever seen, both clad in golden armor and the rider armed with a halberd --- or perhaps just an _ax_ given his giant stature --- and a great shield.

You throw yourself prone just in time for the blade of his ax to sweep over you, and you roll to your feet.

"I have no quarrel with you, sir!"

"_Tarnished! Thy end is now!_" he yells back.

There's no reasoning with your adversary so you decide on the second best course of action: flight. In a mad dash you make for the tree line, and as soon as you dart past the first tree, you climb the second. In four short leaps you're up high, but you still only narrowly swing yourself around the trunk to avoid the knight's blade.

Safety among the upper branches.

"Well?!" you yell down.

He bids his horse to still.

For a moment you wonder if he'll attempt to fell the three you're in with his ax, or perhaps light a fire to smoke you out. He does neither, he just waits, resting his ax on his shoulder.

"Hey, you ass-riding knave!" you call down.

He looks up.

"Are you just gonna wait for me to come down?"

"Yes."

"You'll wait a long time. And you better stay awake or I'll come down there and slit your throat. How about you just ride away and hunt someone else?"

"No."

"Then it will be your funeral!"

Then, there's a howl in the distance, and the knight's horse --- quite unlike a warhorse --- seems to spook.

He casts one glance your way, then rides off in the direction of the sound. You wait until he's well out of earshot before climbing down, and then you continue along the road, but traveling by the tree line.

----

Evening falls by the time you reach the ruins of a holy house of some kind. There's the same statue of a goddess, and there in the center, Grace. However, off to the side is an actual fire, and a man in strange red garb sitting by it.

You crouch down by the Grace and run your fingers through it, as if to greet it were it a small tame animal; it seems to flutter and light up slightly brighter from it.

"Hullo there, Tarnished." says the man.

Standing up, you put a hand on the pommel of your dagger.

"Hoh, friend or foe?"

"Depends," you reply. "You don't seem the combative sort. How do you know what I am?"

"Oh, it is plain to see if you know what to look for. Worry not. Come, sit! Night is falling and I have firewood enough for the evening."

Still cautious, you take a seat across from him.

"I am Kalé, purveyor of fine things, treats, tools, and trinkets."

"I'm afraid I have no coin to trade you for them."

Kalé chuckles. "Oh, no-no, I do not take payment in coin. Ever since the shattering the money of the land has been _runes._" He holds out a hand, manifesting in it a bauble of gold, around which flickers little symbols in the air, with a miniscule glow akin that of Grace.

"And how do I obtain such?"

"Ah, all living beings in the Lands Between contains fragments of the power of the Elden Ring. And they can be yours if you... kill them. The greater the being, the greater the bounty, so to speak."

"And why do you want them?"

"Because everyone wants them. That's how money works."

You look at your hand and focus, thinking back to the soldier you killed. In your hand forms a smaller golden sphere.

"Yes, I see you have already done as your fellows."

"How much bread will this buy?"

Kalé laughs. "Why, a whole loaf and more. What is your name, Stranger?"

"They call me... Jester." _They_ being pretty much only Varre, but you like the idea of not giving your name out too much.

"Jester, hm? Worry not, I shan't pry if you wish to remain anonymous. Why that ekename?"

"On account of my dry and humorless nature."

Kalé chuckles.

"You're the second person now to recognize me as Tarnished on sight; what gives?"

"It's the eyes.Your kind are without Grace."

You look at his eyes. They don't seem entirely normal either. "I was worried for a moment someone has painted it on my forehead without my knowledge."

Another hearty chuckle. "Worry not. My people is a nomadic one: long since been spurned by the Grace of Gold, forcing us to wander a thankless and unending road. But since the shattering things have not been so different for us. I think that makes us kindred spirits of a sort, Jester. Tarnished and Wanderer."

"There are others like you?"

"Fewer now than once there were. Most like me prefer their own company, but most make our living as merchants. In your travels, should you meet one, they'll be sure to reward courtesy and runes with hospitality and wares."

"Surely not all travelers are the honorable sort. What of footpads and highwaymen?"

"My kind bear grudges. And arms."

You venture a question: "Merchant Kalé, are you blind?"

"Perceptive of you to ask. Not entirely. I see... other things more difficult to discern than the mere surface of things, but in return, I see fewer thing. It's a curse --- or blessing --- of my kin."

There's a howl in the distance, the same one that led the knight away from you earlier in the day. "What manner of beast makes such a howl?"

"Ah, he's skulking around these parts again? Not to worry, that one is an honorable warrior."

You nod and fiddle with your ball of runes, splitting it in two, somehow. "I think I'd like that loaf of bread."

"I confess I don't have all that much bread at the moment, let's split one, and I've a keg of wine we can have a cup of --- gratis for you."

You raise an eyebrow. "That's very generous of you."

He fetches the bread and earthenware cups, pouring wine from the tap in the keg. "Bah, this land is tainted by madness and grief, I tell you. There are not an abundance of commerce to be made on the road. Treating you to hospitality is my clever way of making you remember me so you'll bring your business to me a later date. An investment, so to speak."

You accept the cup and the hard, dark bread. It is tough to bite of, but your famine makes the taste is sublime. "Depends. I'm in need of bow and arrow, and whatever else I might need to survive in my travels."

Kalé taps his cheek for a moment. "I am no bowyer nor fletcher, but I do have a set of tools befit a traveler, and manuals on how to use the bounty of the land to make many useful things."

"Sounds like it will cost me more than I have."

"Likely yes. But I will stay here for a few more days, you can come find me then if you come across an unexpected windfall."

"How far to the nearest township?"

"Leagues. There's been a terrible war, you see. Many dead. Villages razed."

You got to sleep wrapped in your cloak by the Grace, rather than the fire, a small magic in and of itself though it may be.

You dream of fire. In the middle of the night, you wake up and look at the Grace. It is still the same alluring gold, but for some reason you get up head to the corner of the ruin where Kalé sleeps by the pile of embers.

You take a few pieces of firewood and stoke the fire a little. Then you wrap yourself in your cloak once more and sit next to him instead, gazing into the flames. Eventually you drift off to sleep again.
