Kenneth offers you an honorary knighthood, you politely decline.

It'll take Haight's forces three moons to muster and march on Stormburg. The week and place is set for when you will join up with Nepheli and enter the city, but until then, there's time to spend.

The last few days have been _staggeringly_ eventful, so some time off isn't unappealing. You spend a day familiarizing yourself with Haft --- ideally you would set out a week for fully exploring the city like you did Morning, but the call of the open road sings to you.

There's a jolly mood in the streets: a siege broken, a city saved. There's no way to prevent the story coming out of a Tarnished in red pelt with a chimera knight having played the pivotal role, but the wolf pelt is too grand a garment to leave off. You're not recognized and congratulated more than twice --- and the third time someone approaches you, it's for a completely different reason.

"Oi! You there! Wait up, cully?"

You turn to see a hillfolk approach you. Black hat and a very small coat, a heavy bag slung over one shoulder. He doesn't stand much taller than hip height, to you.

"Aye?" you ask.

"Ah, pardon milady, I spotted your trousers having a hole there," he points to your leg where you took an arrow. He takes off his hat and bows. "Boc the Seamster, at your service. I could see to a patch job for you, right quick!"

"Can you patch gambeson chausses?"

"Ah! Well, that's a more complicated job with layered linen, but nothing I can't do, ma'am."

"Are you any good, for a seamster?"

"I should think so, otherwise I wouldn't offer my services."

A reasonable position to have. "Very well, master Boc, I'll head to the fort and find a trouser to change into, then come to your workshop with my chausses and this set."

"Oh, ah... I don't actually have a workshop." He says it with good spirits but you feel how he's deeply ashamed by it.

"It's no matter, I'll simply deliver it to your home, then."

"With respect, milady, perhaps if you reside at the fort, I could come do work there?"

You begin to see what might be the case here. "Master Boc, are you a traveling seamster?"

"Of a sorts."

You do not kneel down --- he is no child. "Master Boc, it is no shame to be down on one's luck. You needn't be coy about such matters."

"Ah," he says. "Thank you for your kind sentiment, milady."

"Call me Jester. Listen, walk with me to the fort, mend my clothes there. Then I have a proposition for you."

You turn towards fort Haight. He falls in step beside you, supporting himself occasionally with his knuckles as he walks.

"I do rather a lot of traveling," you explain. "And rather a lot of getting into... fights. I only got this set of clothes a few days ago, and I've already gotten an arrow hole in it."

"An _arrow?_ It's a wonder you can walk, Jester."

"Yeah. And before that, you should have seen the rags I wore, full of stabs and cuts. Point is this: I stand to have need of a seamster on my travels. Rather often, so far. It would be very convenient to have the services of one be available."

"Anytime you're in Haft, I'd be happy to mend your garments," Boc says happily.

You stay your tongue with suggesting what you wanted to: that he travel with you. There are several sites of Grace in Haft --- it'll be easy enough to visit him.

"If you do good work today, you'll be sure to earn a repeat customer."

-----

Leaving Boc to his work, you return to the streets to explore, and return by nightfall for supper, paying him his stated price in runes for service and materials, and a generous tip. It is good work indeed --- the man is clever with his hands.

Supper af the fort is simple, filling to stave off hunger, but as cheaply made as the war effort affords it.

You room with Titania, sleeping in the comfort of her arms as you are wont. But as you make ready for bed, there's a knock on your door.

Titania goes to open.

"Ah, pardons. Is Jester here?"

"Boc?" You come to the door in your nightgown.

He stands there, coat ripped, hat rumpled, and with a clear bruise around one eye.

"What happened to you?"

"N-nothing, ma'am. I'm sorry, I dunno why I came here. I---"

You wave Titania's looming figure off some. "No, no, come in, please."

"I--- I know you said you'd like to make a repeat client of my services, but I'm afraid I can't provide that anymore. I've lost my needles."

You notice him clutching one hand in the other, hiding an injury.

"How?"

He looks away.

The embers of icy rage ignite in your veins. "Who did this to you?"

"Please, you mustn't be mad with them, they don't know how strong they are."

Titania grunts. "Boc, was it?"

He looks to her.

"I'm Nameless."

"Pleasure?"

"Say, you're small, even for hillfolk."

You look between the two of them, sensing the shift in tone.

"When my people beat me up and took my stuff, I said that kind of thing too. I was the runt of the litter --- believe it or not."

Boc looks at her for a spell. "I... I--- well, it's just my older sisters. They love me, don't worry."

Titania sits down on the floor. You head to the table to pour Boc a cup of water. The icy fire in your veins is dying down.

"I'm from down in Morning, you ever heard of it? Down at the southern cape of the Weeping Insula. Back when I was born, my family were slaves. My brothers and sisters were all bigger and stronger, so they all bullied me at every turn."

"Bigger..?"

He accepts the cup from you with his left hand --- he wielded the needle with his right, and you see his fingers are red and swollen.

"I'm small for a chimera."

"Oh. You seem quite mighty to me, Nameless."

"I thought things would always be that way, until I ran away and found out what it was like to be free. My sisters were all picked off by the other males --- some even the slave masters would pair up. I wanted none of it. My brother... he wanted to change things."

Boc is enraptured.

"He staged a revolt. Killed the Lord of Morne. Freed our kin from bondage... and then I returned to see how things were going. Turned out he had become the spitting image of the tyrant he slew --- just as decadent and insufferable."

"Oh dear."

Titania looks down. "I couldn't stand it, so I challenged him to single combat for the title of lord. I had no other choice. He was just as much my brother as I was his sister: we both hate tyrants, he was just the one strong enough to fight."

Boc covers his mouth.

"I was stronger then than when I left, thanks to Jester, and so I beat him down three times. I offered him surrender three times. He refused three times. So... I killed him. "

Boc sniffles loudly. "That's _terrible,_ he--- he forced you to do such a thing? His own..."

Titania nods solemnly. "I made sure he had a fine funeral pyre, then I took the lordship and I've tried to steward Morning towards the kind of freedom you hillfolk and humans enjoy here in Haft."

"You're... you're a Lord?"

"Yep. But before that, I'm Jester's knight and right hand."

Boc looks to you. "What title do you hold, then, milady?"

"One day? Elden Lord. For now? I'm only Nameless' Lord," you say. "Lord Haight has offered me a knighthood, and I've been called Fire Keeper by some."

"To think I disturbed nobility in the middle of the night."

"Never you mind that." Titania takes out her golden bauble. "Here, drink this. I'll fix your hand and bruise."

Boc accepts and drinks. Then he stares in awe at his sewing hand as the swelling dies and whatever injury was there vanishes.

"How old are you?"

He looks up suddenly. "Twenty-five summers."

"Very young for hillfolk," Titania supplies.

You walk over and take a seat next to Boc. "Listen, master Boc. You served me well, and I was hoping to secure your service for Nameless' clothing as well. I am also loath to see you hurt --- no matter by whom. I promise I am not to mete out vengeance, but I cannot let such an injustice stand right in front of me. Just as I helped Nameless, allow us to help you."

He looks at his hand, and gives Titania back her bauble. "It was my sisters. Ever since my mother perished and they took over the family, they have only been harder on me. When I came home, they were displeased with how I had left home and taken work at the fort, took my runes, and... broke my fingers. They want me to stay home and only work for them."

"That's slavery," Titania says quietly.

"I suppose, but..."

You get up and pull off your nightgown, grabbing your undershirt to get dressed.

"Milady?" Boc asks.

"Boc, stay here with Nameless. I'll go talk some sense into your sisters and get your needles back."

"Please don't hurt them."

"I'm not going to bring my sword or shield, nor call fire upon them, I promise."

"You sure?" Titania asks.

"Yeah," you say. "Boc, the address?"

"I, uh... I'm not sure if I shouldn't go and show you the way."

You look at Titania who nods and goes to grab her clothes as well.

----

You bring only your dagger and gauntlets, leaving plate and blade at home. The night's chill is biting as the three of you make your way through the dark by the light of a flame in your palm.

"Left here, and then it's down at the end of the street."

The building is dilapidated --- hillfolk may be free in Haft, but they are not rich.

"Second floor."

You nod to Titania. She nods back.

Then you enter alone, heading up the steps. On the second floor you hammer on the door and wait.

Not long after, the door opens to a hillfolk woman who's as tall as you. You have no idea what the beauty standards are for hillfolk, but she has prominent canines and greasy hair. "_What the fuck do you want?_"

"Friend of Boc's. Give me back his stuff --- he works for me now. Keep the runes you stole from him, and praise yourself lucky he is such a sweet and forgiving person."

She laughs. "Go jump off a cliff." Then she tries to slam the door in your face, but you kick it hard enough to send her stumbling back.

"I'm sorry, was I unclear?"

"Bast!" she yells.

You step inside, into a living space that is reasonably tidy, but bears signs of the occupants not being overly concerned with cleanliness --- probably only Boc that used to clean this place.

An even bigger hillfolk woman rises in the corner, and grabs a blade.

"Step aside, Biddy," she grumbles. "I'll gut this fucker." She stalks towards you menacingly, knife raised to stab.

You stand your ground and reach out with your fire to heat the metal in the blade to boiling hot.

Bast yelps, dropping the blade, and you call fire inside yourself to grant you strength. "If you don't give me Boc's things, I'm going to start handing out beatings --- justly deserved it would seem."

Your father taught you how. He was not a merciful man.

The smaller one, Biddy, jumps you, and you dodge her lunging claw swipe, dealing her a resounding blow to the jaw. Bast tackles you against the wall and tries to bite you in the shoulder, but you get your thumb on her throat and put an elbow in her back and a knee in her chest, then force her off you. Biddy comes at you again and you kick her in the chest.

You block Bast's jab and deliver an uppercut that sends her ass-over-end onto the floor.

"How the fuck is a human so strong," Biddy mutters.

"Boc's things, or I'm gonna start breaking your bones on purpose."

Bast grabs a piece of furniture and throws it at you, which you have to dive to the side to avoid. Biddy jumps you and tries to bite your arm. You poke her eyes and as she recoils in pain you grab hold of her arm and break her elbow, then slam her head into the wall, once, twice---

Then Bast comes to her sister's rescue, grabbing you from behind. You headbutt her in the nose, stomp hard on her foot, grab hold of her hand, and throw her overhead. While she's down you kick her in the ribs, once, twice, thrice---

"Please don't hurt my sister anymore..." Biddy sniffles on the floor. Blood flows freely from a split lip.

You stop. Bast coughs and groans, holding her side.

"Where's Boc's stuff?"

She points to a bag hung from the rafters above, and you recognize it. You stand on your toes to reach it, and as you head for the door, two city guards burst in.

"What in Marika's name is going on here!"

"She's robbing us!" Biddy cries.

"Ma'am you're under arrest," one of them say.

You hold up a hand. "That one is a liar. Permit me to explain?"

They exchange glances. "You've committed robbery, ma'am. You're handing that back and coming with us to see the judge. Spare your breath, you're not talking yourself out of this."

You shrug and drop the bag. "Lord Haight will not be pleased with either of us, it seems." Then you turn to Biddy. "My friend will be by to get this bag in a little. You're gonna give it to her willingly --- she's bigger and meaner than I am."

Then you follow the two guards willingly down the stairs and into the street, where a few more guards are standing, talking to Titania and Boc.

"Nameless!" you call. "Go get his stuff."

"Shut up," one of the guards say, and they take you away through the dark streets to the gaol. There your name and crime is written, and the warden puts you in a small cell. The bench isn't long enough to sleep on.

-----

You don't spend very long behind bars, as one of Kenneth's hirdmen come by the next morning to fetch you. You follow the yellow-clad knight though the streets of Haft to the fort, and there to a study where Kenneth himself sits behind a desk, strewn with parchments. The room is lit with two candle holders of five candles each.

With the respectful posture your father taught you, you stand at attention.

"Jester," he says.

"Lord Haight."

"I hear you went and assaulted two of my citizens in their own home yestereve."

"I did."

He looks at you, steepling his fingers. "The punishment for that crime is six moons in the gaol, or three fingers off the left hand. Or since you're not a Haft citizen, ten lashes and exile."

"I'll take the lashes and exile."

"Figured you might. I'm willing to issue you a pardon on account of your importance to the attack on Stormburg, provided you give me an explanation."

"It concerned my personal seamster, master Boc. The two I beat up are Boc's sisters, Biddy and Bast. They broke his hand stole the tools of his trade --- I was merely there on his behalf to retrieve them, and they decided to assault me instead of giving back what they stole. I was merciful as to neither use flame nor blade against them --- only my fists and boots."

Kenneth looks at you for a long spell. "You acted on your personal justice to see to the safety and dignity of one in your charge. I can respect that, but you should have gone to report the crime instead. Had you accepted the knighthood, I would have punished you severely. Never do this again --- _ever._ And don't think yourself ever fully as welcome in my city as you were this morning."

"Yes, my lord."

-----

Returning to your and Titania's room gets you a warm welcome. Titania wraps you up in one of her engulfing hugs, and you barely notice that Boc is also present.

"That was very stupid," she says.

"First time for everything."

She sits down on the floor. "What did Lord Haight say?"

"That I best never do anything like that again, and also it would be better if I left but he's not going to evict me."

Titania pats you on the shoulder. "Good."

Boc clears his throat. "So, uh. Thank you, truly. Jester, you of course, but also you, Nameless. I--- I can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to help me of the goodness of their hearts." He wipes an eye. "I obviously don't have a place to call home, anymore, but I remember you said you have need of a tailor in your travels... so if you'll have me, might I come along?"

"Yes," you say, immediately.

"It'll be dangerous," Titania cautions. "You're not a fighter, master Boc."

"I--- er..."

"We'll protect him, train him," you say to Titania. "It won't be a problem, Boc."

She looks at you for a long moment. "If you say so, we'll make it so."

-----

You get your affairs in order --- mostly letting Nepheli know where you will be going and buying some extra supplies for the road: earthenware jars for your strange fermentations, and a few tailor's goods for Boc.
