# Manners Maketh

Kenneth offers you an honorary knighthood, you politely decline.

It'll take Haight's forces three moons to muster and march on Stormburg. The week and place is set for when you will join up with Nepheli and enter the city, but until then, there's time to spend.

The last few days have been _staggeringly_ eventful, so some time off isn't unappealing. You spend a day familiarizing yourself with Haft --- ideally you would set out a week for fully exploring the city like you did Morning, but the call of the open road sings to you.

There's a jolly mood in the streets: a siege broken, a city saved. There's no way to prevent the story coming out of a Tarnished in red pelt with a chimera knight having played the pivotal role, but the wolf pelt is too grand a garment to leave off. You're not recognized and congratulated more than twice --- and the third time someone approaches you, it's for a completely different reason.

"Oi! You there! Wait up, cully?"

You turn to see a hillfolk approach you. Black hat and a very small coat, a heavy bag slung over one shoulder. He doesn't stand much taller than hip height, to you.

"Aye?" you ask.

"Ah, pardon milady, I spotted your trousers having a hole there," he points to your leg where you took an arrow. He takes off his hat and bows. "Boc the Seamster, at your service. I could see to a patch job for you, right quick!"

"Can you patch gambeson chausses?"

"Ah! Well, that's a more complicated job with layered linen, but nothing I can't do, ma'am."

"Are you any good, for a seamster?"

"I should think so, otherwise I wouldn't offer my services."

A reasonable position to have. "Very well, master Boc, I'll head to the fort and find a trouser to change into, then come to your workshop with my chausses and this set."

"Oh, ah... I don't actually have a workshop." He says it with good spirits but you feel how he's deeply ashamed by it.

"It's no matter, I'll simply deliver it to your home, then."

"With respect, milady, perhaps if you reside at the fort, I could come do work there?"

You begin to see what might be the case here. "Master Boc, are you a traveling seamster?"

"Of a sorts."

You do not kneel down --- he is no child. "Master Boc, it is no shame to be down on one's luck. You needn't be coy about such matters."

"Ah," he says. "Thank you for your kind sentiment, milady."

"Call me Jester. Listen, walk with me to the fort, mend my clothes there. Then I have a proposition for you."

You turn towards fort Haight. He falls in step beside you, supporting himself occasionally with his knuckles as he walks.

"I do rather a lot of traveling," you explain. "And rather a lot of getting into... fights. I only got this set of clothes a few days ago, and I've already gotten an arrow hole in it."

"An _arrow?_ It's a wonder you can walk, Jester."

"Yeah. And before that, you should have seen the rags I wore, full of stabs and cuts. Point is this: I stand to have need of a seamster on my travels. Rather often, so far. It would be very convenient to have the services of one be available."

"Anytime you're in Haft, I'd be happy to mend your garments," Boc says happily.

You stay your tongue with suggesting what you wanted to: that he travel with you. There are several sites of Grace in Haft --- it'll be easy enough to visit him.

"If you do good work today, you'll be sure to earn a repeat customer."

-----

Leaving Boc to his work, you return to the streets to explore, and return by nightfall for supper, paying him his stated price in runes for service and materials, and a generous tip. It is good work indeed --- the man is clever with his hands.

Supper af the fort is simple, filling to stave off hunger, but as cheaply made as the war effort affords it.

You room with Titania, sleeping in the comfort of her arms as you are wont. But as you make ready for bed, there's a knock on your door.

Titania goes to open.

"Ah, pardons. Is Jester here?"

"Boc?" You come to the door in your nightgown.

He stands there, coat ripped, hat rumpled, and with a clear bruise around one eye.

"What happened to you?"

"N-nothing, ma'am. I'm sorry, I dunno why I came here. I---"

You wave Titania's looming figure off some. "No, no, come in, please."

"I--- I know you said you'd like to make a repeat client of my services, but I'm afraid I can't provide that anymore. I've lost my needles."

You notice him clutching one hand in the other, hiding an injury.

"How?"

He looks away.

The embers of icy rage ignite in your veins. "Who did this to you?"

"Please, you mustn't be mad with them, they don't know how strong they are."

Titania grunts. "Boc, was it?"

He looks to her.

"I'm Nameless."

"Pleasure?"

"Say, you're small, even for hillfolk."

You look between the two of them, sensing the shift in tone.

"When my people beat me up and took my stuff, I said that kind of thing too. I was the runt of the litter --- believe it or not."

Boc looks at her for a spell. "I... I--- well, it's just my older sisters. They love me, don't worry."

Titania sits down on the floor. You head to the table to pour Boc a cup of water. The icy fire in your veins is dying down.

"I'm from down in Morning, you ever heard of it? Down at the southern cape of the Weeping Insula. Back when I was born, my family were slaves. My brothers and sisters were all bigger and stronger, so they all bullied me at every turn."

"Bigger..?"

He accepts the cup from you with his left hand --- he wielded the needle with his right, and you see his fingers are red and swollen.

"I'm small for a chimera."

"Oh. You seem quite mighty to me, Nameless."

"I thought things would always be that way, until I snuck out and away and found out what it was like to be free. My sisters were all picked by the other males --- some even the slave masters would pair up. I wanted none of it. My brother... he wanted to change things."

Boc is enraptured.

"He staged a revolt. Killed the Lord of Morne. Freed our kin from bondage... and then I returned to see how things were going. Turned out he had become the spitting image of the tyrant he slew --- just as decadent and insufferable."

"Oh dear."

Titania looks down. "I couldn't stand it, so I challenged him to single combat for the title of lord. I had no other choice. He was just as much my brother as I was his sister: we both hate tyrants, he was just the one strong enough to fight."

Boc covers his mouth.

"I was stronger then than when I left, thanks to Jester, and so I beat him down three times. I offered him surrender three times. He refused three times. So... I killed him. "

Boc sniffles loudly. "That's _terrible,_ he--- he forced you to do such a thing? His own..."

Titania nods solemnly. "I made sure he had a fine funeral pyre, then I took the lordship and I've tried to steward Morning towards the kind of freedom you hillfolk and humans enjoy here in Haft."

"You're... you're a Lord?"

"Yep. But before that, I'm Jester's knight and right hand."

Boc looks to you. "What title do you hold, then, milady?"

"One day? Elden Lord. For now? I'm only Nameless' Lord," you say. "Lord Haight has offered me a knighthood, and I've been called Fire Keeper by some."

"To think I disturbed nobility in the middle of the night."

"Never you mind that." Titania takes out her golden bauble. "Here, drink this. I'll fix your hand and bruise."

Boc accepts and drinks. Then he stares in awe at his sewing hand as the swelling dies and whatever injury was there vanishes.

"How old are you?"

He looks up suddenly. "Twenty-five summers."

"Young for hillfolk," Titania supplies.

You walk over and take a seat next to Boc. "Listen, master Boc. You served me well, and I was hoping to secure your service for Nameless' clothing as well. I am also loath to see you hurt --- no matter by whom. I promise I am not to mete out vengeance, but I cannot let such an injustice stand right in front of me. Just as I helped Nameless, allow us to help you."

He looks at his hand, and gives Titania back her bauble. "It was my sisters. Mother left them in charge --- they're not so bad compared. When I came home, they were displeased with how I had left home and taken work at the fort, took my runes, and... broke my fingers. They want me to stay home and only work for them."

"That's slavery," Titania says quietly.

"I suppose, but..."

You get up and pull off your nightgown, grabbing your undershirt to get dressed.

"Milady?" Boc asks.

"Boc, stay here with Nameless. I'll go talk some sense into your sisters and get your needles back."

"Please don't hurt them."

"I'm not going to bring my sword or shield, nor call fire upon them, I promise."

"You sure?" Titania asks.

"Yeah," you say. "Boc, the address?"

"I, uh... I'm not sure if I shouldn't go and show you the way."

You look at Titania who nods and goes to grab her clothes as well.

----

You bring only your dagger and gauntlets, leaving plate and blade at home. The night's chill is biting as the three of you make your way through the dark by the light of a flame in your palm.

"Left here, and then it's down at the end of the street."

The building is dilapidated --- hillfolk may be free in Haft, but they are not rich.

"Second floor."

You nod to Titania. She nods back.

Then you enter alone, heading up the steps. On the second floor you hammer on the door and wait.

Not long after, the door opens to a hillfolk woman who's as tall as you. You have no idea what the beauty standards are for hillfolk, but she has prominent canines and greasy hair. "_What the fuck do you want?_"

"Friend of Boc's. Give me back his stuff --- he works for me now. Keep the runes you stole from him, and count your blessings he is such a sweet and forgiving person."

She laughs. "Go jump off a cliff." Then she tries to slam the door in your face, but you kick it hard enough to send her stumbling back.

"I'm sorry, was I unclear?"

"Bast!" she yells.

You step inside, into a living space that is reasonably tidy, but bears signs of the occupants not being overly concerned with cleanliness --- probably only Boc that used to clean this place.

An even bigger hillfolk woman rises in the corner, and grabs a blade.

"Step aside, Biddy," she grumbles. "I'll gut this fucker." She stalks towards you menacingly, knife raised to stab.

You stand your ground and reach out with your fire to heat the metal in the blade to boiling hot.

Bast yelps, dropping the blade, and you call fire inside yourself to grant you strength. "If you don't give me Boc's things, I'm going to start handing out beatings --- justly deserved it would seem."

Your father taught you how. He was not a merciful man.

The smaller one, Biddy, jumps you, and you dodge her lunging claw swipe, dealing her a resounding blow to the jaw. Bast tackles you against the wall and tries to bite you in the shoulder, but you get your thumb on her throat and put an elbow in her back and a knee in her chest, then force her off you. Biddy comes at you again and you kick her in the chest.

You block Bast's jab and deliver an uppercut that sends her ass-over-end onto the floor.

"How the fuck is a human so strong," Biddy mutters.

"Boc's things, or I'm gonna start breaking your bones on purpose."

Bast grabs a piece of furniture and throws it at you, which you have to dive to the side to avoid. Biddy jumps you and tries to bite your arm. You poke her eyes and as she recoils in pain you grab hold of her arm and break her elbow, then slam her head into the wall, once, twice---

Then Bast comes to her sister's rescue, grabbing you from behind. You headbutt her in the nose, stomp hard on her foot, grab hold of her hand, and throw her overhead. While she's down you kick her in the ribs, once, twice, thrice---

"Please don't hurt my sister anymore..." Biddy sniffles on the floor. Blood flows freely from a split lip.

You stop. Bast coughs and groans, holding her side.

"Where's Boc's stuff?"

She points to a bag hung from the rafters above, and you recognize it. You stand on your toes to reach it, and as you head for the door, two city guards burst in.

"What in Marika's name is going on here!"

"She's robbing us!" Biddy cries.

"Ma'am you're under arrest," one of them say.

You hold up a hand. "That one is a liar. Permit me to explain?"

They exchange glances. "You've committed robbery, ma'am. You're handing that back and coming with us to see the judge. Spare your breath, you're not talking yourself out of this."

You shrug and drop the bag. "Lord Haight will not be pleased with either of us, it seems." Then you turn to Biddy. "My friend will be by to get this bag in a little. You're gonna give it to her willingly --- she's bigger and meaner than I am."

Then you follow the two guards willingly down the stairs and into the street, where a few more guards are standing, talking to Titania and Boc.

"Nameless!" you call. "Go get his stuff."

"Shut up," one of the guards say, and they take you away through the dark streets to the gaol. There your name and crime is written, and the warden puts you in a small cell. The bench isn't long enough to sleep on.

-----

You don't spend very long behind bars, as one of Kenneth's hirdmen come by the next morning to fetch you. You follow the yellow-clad knight though the streets of Haft to the fort, and there to a study where Kenneth himself sits behind a desk, strewn with parchments. The room is lit with two candle holders of five candles each.

With the respectful posture your father taught you, you stand at attention.

"Jester," he says.

"Lord Haight."

"I hear you went and assaulted two of my citizens in their own home yestereve."

"I did."

He looks at you, steepling his fingers. "The punishment for that crime is six moons in the gaol, or three fingers off the left hand. But since you're not a Haft citizen, I might see to it that you only get ten lashes and exile."

"I'll take the lashes and exile."

"Figured you might. I'm willing to issue you a pardon on account of your importance to the attack on Stormburg, provided you give me an explanation."

"It concerned my personal seamster, master Boc. The two I beat up are Boc's sisters, Biddy and Bast. They broke his hand stole the tools of his trade --- I was merely there on his behalf to retrieve them, and they decided to assault me instead of giving back what they stole. I was merciful as to neither use flame nor blade against them --- only my fists and boots."

Kenneth looks at you for a long spell. "You acted on your personal justice to see to the safety and dignity of one in your charge. I can respect that, but you should have gone to report the crime instead. Had you accepted the knighthood, I would have punished you severely. Never do this again --- _ever._ And don't think yourself ever fully as welcome in my city as you were this morning."

"Yes, my lord."

-----

Returning to your and Titania's room gets you a warm welcome. Titania wraps you up in one of her engulfing hugs, and you barely notice that Boc is also present.

"That was very stupid," she says.

"First time for everything."

She sits down on the floor. "What did Lord Haight say?"

"That I best never do anything like that again, and also it would be better if I left but he's not going to evict me."

Titania pats you on the shoulder. "Good. Went in after you and they coughed up Boc's stuff, no problem. I just asked nicely."

"Thought as much."

Boc clears his throat. "So, uh... Thank you, truly. Jester, you of course, but also you, Nameless. I--- I can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to help me of the goodness of their hearts." He wipes an eye. "I obviously don't have a place to call home, anymore, but I remember you said you have need of a tailor in your travels... so if you'll have me, might I come along?"

"Yes," you say, immediately.

"It'll be dangerous," Titania cautions. "You're not a fighter, master Boc."

"I--- er..."

"We'll protect him, train him," you say to Titania. "It won't be a problem, Boc."

She looks at you for a long moment. "If you say so, we'll make it so."

You get your affairs in order --- mostly letting Nepheli know where you will be going and buying some extra supplies for the road: jars for your strange fermentations and experiments and spices and oils for cooking, a shovel and pickax for Titania, and for Boc, cloth, thread, needles, an extra pair of scissors, and other tools you don't recognize.

Then you set out into the Limgrave countryside. In search of what, you know not.

-----

Boc rides along on Squall, perched atop one of the saddlebags --- he's practically small enough to sit on Titania's shoulder, and his feet have thumbs for holding on. Quite a convenience, in your opinion.

"Where did you learn to sew?" Titania asks.

"Taught meself. Mother said I had to earn my keep, and since I wasn't so strong as Bast or Biddy, I could at least save us the runes on patching her work robe. She was a builder --- worked with the masons and carpenters, lifting heavy things. We were poor. She spent a lot of her wages at the drinking house, then if she was in a bad mood when she came home, she'd beat us --- if I was sewing, sometimes she left me alone."

Now you feel a little bad for beating the tar out of his sisters.

"Why did she leave?" Titania asks.

"I don't know. Maybe to work elsewhere. Bast and Biddy aren't good at finding work, so they made me provide for the household."

"Stupid of them to hurt your hand, then."

"Yeah, I guess... Jester?" he looks your way.

"Boc?"

"What's your story?"

You ride on a little in silence.

"When I was a girl, my Father told me one day we'd return to the Lands Between. That the glass desert's beauty was nothing compared to the splendor of the great golden tree. He taught me to fight and to survive, told me stories. Then when he died, he gave me his sword."

"Oh."

"Then I was called by Grace. I left by sea. We were a crew of strangers, but we looked out for each other --- I don't remember how we even ended up on the same ship. I don't recall all that much before coming here."

"How long you been here?"

"Three moons. We came ashore and people started dying in droves. Killing each other. Being killed by strange beings. I got in a fight with my captain. Then a monster killed me, and I woke up in a strange cave with a beautiful woman."

"They're together, now," Titania adds. "Jester and that beautiful woman."

"Oh? But there's just us? Where is she?"    

"We're lovers," you clarify. "Her situation is a peculiar one. You'll meet her soon enough."

"Hold up," Boc says, and hops off Squall. He darts to the side of the road, and takes out his knife.

"What is?" you ask.

"Linen-reeds," he says, harvesting the tall grass. "There's these long fibers inside --- good for braiding. Ah, good and dry."

You both watch as he works, cutting open the outer husks and digging out the masses of fiber inside, until he has a small armful. Then Titania helps him stow it in one saddle bag and he takes his seat on the other again.

"What are you thinking to braid?" Titania asks.

"A sling. What you said, that I'm not a fighter, is true. In Haft, not much use of it, but where where I was born, everyone used them. For hunting and sporting... and self-defense."

"Why did you leave?" You ask.

"My father was cruel to us. Mother took us and ran away in the night --- many, many moons ago. Bast was only just a grown girl, Biddy was a girl, and Mother carried me on her back. Bah, enough about that sadness. I'm going to braid a sling --- maybe a spare. It's been an age since I slung anything --- if we go down the coast we can hunt puffins. It's been an a hundred moons since I had puffin toes."

"I've got some vinegar we can pickle them in," you say, patting Torrent's saddlebag.

-----

You do indeed get to enjoy the puffins. And rowas and sallow yams and wild goat and dark trailbread from Haft: all your bellies desire.

In the course of a week in the saddle, Boc slings enough stones to ruin one of his slings from the wear alone. His accuracy is impressive and only gets better by the day, one whip-cracking throw at a time. He also eats more than you, despite being half your size.

But you don't summon Melina --- she needs her rest.

On a rainy day, you find a nice grace in the deep woods to camp out at for a while, setting up an actual tent of linseed-waxed canvas. Under there, you set your skillet on a rock, calling on heat not from fire to render it sizzling hot. A glob of rendered tallow serves to coat the pan, and you slice the left-over mutton shoulder into strips to fry. You even have a jar of salt to season with.

"You know, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here," Bow says, paging through the heavy tome that is your field manual. He speaks quietly --- Titania is napping.

"Probably. You're more literate than me."

He looks up. "Oh? But you know most things written in here."

You shake your head. "I have spent weeks reading it --- I still have to spell my way through some words. We didn't have books where I grew up. My father taught me to read drawing letters in the sand with a stick."

"Oh. I went to a libre school back in Haft. We got shafted by a swindler, and Mother put me to the task of learning to read and do sums so it'd never happen again. She was smart. Not very kind, not very clever, but she never let the same bad thing happen to us twice."

"Except herself."

"Yeah. Good riddance."

You hold the skillet out for him and he skewers a slice of meat on his knife, letting it cool off, careful not to drip tallow on the book.

"Did you ever read the chapter about Hermeticism?"

"No, it was far too dense for me. Maybe you can explain?"

"Well..." he pages some. "Cully, you really putting me on the spot. It's a form of magic or miracle working --- like your flame calling. But it takes very little other than putting the right things together, and things happen."

"Such as?"

He gobbles down the entire slice of meat in a single mouthful; he wipes his knife in his jacket and sheathes it. Placing a finger on the page, he begins reading: "_In a suitable cauldron, brew tallow of pork with the wings of the crimson butterflies that draw to smoke and bonfires, to this mixture add ash of linwood and a pinch of quicklime._ Then there's a description of the stir pattern, and time of day that makes it work best..."

"What does it do?"

"This recipe makes a kind of paste that can... explode. Says hermeticists used to brew great batches of it for weapons in sieges long ago."

You look at him for a long spell.

"Only problem is... like, I'd be wanting to put such a thing in a small jar or pack it tightly in leather or something, so it'd fit in my sling. But that'd be a terrible waste of a nice jar."

He reads on while you eat, setting aside some for Titania. You stare at the Grace and sigh.

"What's wrong?"

"Do you like traveling with us, Boc?"

"I do, Jester. You two are kind to me --- not many are. And I'm your seamster: a very important service for an Elden Lord."

You look at him. "You really think I can become Elden Lord?"

He shrugs. "I wouldn't know, but even if you don't, I don't see why I shouldn't be your seamster anyway."

"My real name is Ezekiel."

That makes him look up. "Oh."

"And Nameless is Titania --- I gave her that name when first we met and she became my knight."

Boc looks at Titania, sitting against the great old tree you're camping under, at the back of the tent.

"We're bound together by fate. I am chosen by higher powers to do great deeds and change the world, and she has been chosen to guard my back like my own shadow."

"Can't do great deeds and change the world while wearing rags, cully," Boc says.

You giggle at that.

The rain keeps falling.

------

Titania wakes you with a rough shake and a hand over your mouth, you read danger in her eyes and a finger across her lips. Boc is awake, too, and looks afraid, knife and stone in one hand, sling in the other.

"_Rune bear,_" Titania whispers.

Out in the dark you hear something shuffling about.

You reach for your sword. You've heard of them --- great big beasts, bears somehow transformed and made monstrous. One of the creatures of the Lands Between that are not afraid of fire.

"_It's gotten our scent, get ready._"

Titania creeps into the darkness, beyond silently. You head out, sword aflight and shield in hand, putting yourself between the noise out there and Boc.

The noise then becomes a tremendous roar --- two roars --- and you see a gigantic shadow rush out of the dark straight towards you. Instinctively your sword is already in its path,
