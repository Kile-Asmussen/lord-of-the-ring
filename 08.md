Kenneth offers you an honorary knighthood, you politely decline.

It'll take Haight's forces three moons to muster and march on Stormburg. The week and place is set for when you will join up with Nepheli and enter the city, but until then, there's time to spend.

The last few days have been _staggeringly_ eventful, so some time off isn't unappealing. You spend a day familiarizing yourself with Haft --- ideally you would set out a week for fully exploring the city like you did Morning, but the call of the open road sings to you.

There's a jolly mood in the streets: a siege broken, a city saved. There's no way to prevent the story coming out of a Tarnished in red pelt with a chimera knight having played the pivotal role, but the wolf pelt is too grand a garment to leave off. You're not recognized and congratulated more than twice --- and the third time someone approaches you, it's for a completely different reason.

"Oi! You there! Wait up, cully?"

You turn to see a hillfolk approach you. Black hat and a very small coat, a heavy bag slung over one shoulder. He doesn't stand much taller than hip height, to you.

"Aye?" you ask.

"Ah, pardon milady, I spotted your trousers having a hole there," he points to your leg where you took an arrow. He takes off his hat and bows. "Boc the Seamster, at your service. I could see to a patch job for you, right quick!"

"Can you patch gambeson chausses?"

"Ah! Well, that's a more complicated job with layered linen, but nothing I can't do, ma'am."

"Are you any good, for a seamster?"

"I should think so, otherwise I wouldn't offer my services."

A reasonable position to have. "Very well, master Boc, I'll head to the fort and find a trouser to change into, then come to your workshop with my chausses and this set."

"Oh, ah... I don't actually have a workshop." He says it with good spirits but you feel how he's deeply ashamed by it.

"It's no matter, I'll simply deliver it to your home, then."

"With respect, milady, perhaps if you reside at the fort, I could come do work there?"

You begin to see what might be the case here. "Master Boc, are you a traveling seamster?"

"Of a sorts."

Very notably you do not kneel down. "Master Boc, it is no shame to be down on one's luck."

"Ah," he says. "Thank you for your kind sentiment, milady."

"Call me Jester. Listen, walk with me to the fort, mend my clothes there. Then I have a proposition for you."

You turn towards fort Haight. He falls in step beside you, supporting himself occasionally with his knuckles as he walks.

"I do rather a lot of traveling," you explain. "And rather a lot of getting into... fights. I only got this set of clothes a few days ago, and I've already gotten an arrow hole in it."

"An _arrow?_ It's a wonder you can walk, Jester."

"Yeah. And before that, you should have seen the rags I wore, full of stabs and cuts. Point is this: I stand to have need of a seamster on my travels. Rather often, so far. It would be very convenient to have the services of one be available."

"Anytime you're in Haft, I'd be happy to mend your garments," Boc says happily.

You stay your tongue with suggesting what you wanted to: that he travel with you. There are several sites of Grace in Haft --- it'll be easy enough to visit him.

"If you do good work today, you'll be sure to earn a repeat customer."

-----

Leaving Boc to his work, you return to the streets to explore, and return by nightfall for supper, paying him his stated price in runes for service and materials, and a generous tip. It is good work indeed --- the man is clever with his hands.

Supper af the fort is simple, filling to stave off hunger, but as cheaply made as the war effort affords it.

You room with Titania, sleeping in the comfort of her arms as you are wont. But as you make ready for bed, there's a knock on your door.

Titania goes to open.

"Ah, pardons. Is Jester here?"

"Boc?" You come to the door in your nightgown.

He stands there, coat ripped, hat rumpled, and with a clear bruise around one eye.

"What happened to you?"

"N-nothing, ma'am. I'm sorry, I dunno why I came here. I---"

You wave Titania's looming figure off some. "No, no, come in, please."

"I--- I know you said you'd like to make a repeat client of my services, but I'm afraid I can't provide that anymore. I've lost my needles."

You notice him clutching one hand in the other.

"How?"

He looks away.

The embers of icy rage ignite in your veins. "Who did this to you?"

"Please, you mustn't be mad with them, they don't know how strong they are."

Titania grunts. "Boc, was it?"

He looks to her.

"I'm Nameless."

"Pleasure?"

"Say, you're small, even for hillfolk."

You look between the two of them, sensing the shift in tone.

"When my people beat me up and took my stuff, I said that kind of thing too. I was the runt of the litter --- believe it or not."

Boc looks at her for a spell. "I... I--- well, it's just my older sisters. They love me, don't worry."

Titania sits down on the floor. You head to the table to pour Boc a cup of water. The icy fire in your veins is dying down.

"I'm from down in Morning, you ever heard of it? Down at the southern cape of the Weeping Insula. Back when I was born, my family were slaves. My brothers and sisters were all bigger and stronger, so they all bullied me at every turn."

"Bigger..?"

"I'm small for a chimera."

"Oh. You seem quite mighty to me, Nameless."

"I thought things would always be that way, until I ran away and found out what it was like to be free. My sisters were all picked off by the other males --- some even the slave masters would pair up. I wanted none of it. My brother... he wanted to change things."

Boc is enraptured.

"He staged a revolt. Killed the Lord of Morne. Freed our kin from bondage... and then I returned to see how things were going. Turned out he had become the spitting image of the tyrant he slew --- just as decadent and insufferable."
