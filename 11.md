# From Fringefolk to Stormhill

Your journey west takes you to the ocean proper, and it becomes reality that you have crossed the breadth of Limgrave, from the insea to the outersea --- the horizon is wreathed in the fog you crossed to to arrive here in the Lands Between.

Out beyond it lies the Land of Glass, where you were born. The coastal city of Ishe, where your father took you to see the duke's men march in parade.

"One day, daughter mine, when you grow up, will you fight for the downtrodden?" you quote.

The ocean wind blows about the three of you.

"What's that, Cully?"

"Something my father asked me. I was too young to know what it meant, then. But... chimera, hillfolk, living jars... sure seems there's plenty of downtrodden to fight for."

"We have our work cut out for us," Titania agrees.

You follow the coast south for a day's ride, reaching Fringefolk. It is a mellow harbor town, with ships coming to and fro --- fishing vessels, trade vessels, and even warships. The houses have roves of tile rather than straw, and the streets are lively, seeming more prosperous than Haft, if smaller.

The reason for the apparent prosperity becomes clear once you reach the docks: slavery. Of hillfolk, chimera, and humans. You feel both Titania and Boc's rage. There's free hillfolk and chimera, too, but even just on your walk through the city has given you the impression that they are treated with less than dignity and respect.

But there is little to do. Soldiers and watchmen patrol the streets, and the banner of Godrick flies on the city walls and the masts of ships in harbor.

You negotiate passage on a ferry to the small isle out in the bay, and sail across the clear waters at noon. Titania stays with the boatman to make sure he doesn't slip away and leave you stranded.

Up on the highest point of the island is a circle of standing stones, and a basin carved in stone that burns with a dark flame --- one that feels familiar to you: the bloodflame. No trace of fuel for this fire is to be found.

A little down the hill is a shack, and before the eternal flame, sits a... man or woman, hard to tell. Visibly ancient and weathered, with long gray hair, in clothes that are old and worn.

"Hullo!" you call out. "Is this the church of the dragon cult?"

The old hermit rises from the paving stones. "Who comes to ask?"

"I am Jester, this is my friend Boc. He has eaten the heart of one of Agheel's brood. The traveling warrior Yura directed us here. He has gone north in search of the traitor Eleanora."

The hermit nods. "Yes, the Caelid chapter. I heard of that tragedy. Alas, I am all that is left of the faithful here. I am Johannae... Come let me see you, boy."

Boc trots over, and Johannae inspects his eyes. "Indeed, you are making fine way on the path of the Dragon."

"With respect, master Johannae, I am also a seamster. I could patch some of the holes in your robe while you teach me?"

-----

You spend the next few days taking the ferry back and forth to the island, letting Boc take lessons from Johannae.

The ferryman is a nice fellow by the name of Olaf, who has a wife and child, and is thankful for you providing him with easy work.

You spend your time on the island meditating on the nature of fire, while Titania spends her days practicing fishing. There's even a hallow of Grace on the island, and you take Melina for a stroll on the beach.

What Boc learns, he keeps fiercely secret, but after week's tutelage Johannae deems that Boc has learned all that he can, and sends you on your way.

You pay Olaf for the trip back, but remain on the island with Titania and Boc.

"Care to tell why you deliberately stranded us here, Cully?"

"There's a thing I need to know if you can learn." You lead the three of you to the hallow of Grace nestled in between the rocks on the beach.

With Titania's instruction, Boc takes to using the trick of the light, quite well. But same as her, he does not see the Guidance that leads you to effortlessly finding the hallows of Grace.

And then you take him to the Roundtable Hold.

-----

It's been over a moon since you've been here, but it seems much the same. Despondent Tarnished still sit along the floors and in the halls. Fia still likely stalks the halls in search of prey.

There's no sight of Brother Corhyn, but Dee is there, and Titania greets him like an old friend. He introduces the three of you to a sorcerer by the name of Rogierre.

And then Gideon Ofnir comes out of his library. You intercept him before he can approach where Titania is introducing Boc to Dee and Rogierre.

"Ah. I thought I heard a commotion. Prithee, Ezekiel Flamecaller, what rabble have you brought to the Hold this time?"

"It's of no concern of yours who I bring here, Gideon Ofnir."

"I should think _I_ get to decide that."

"Yes, because I am a mere 'visitor' while you hold a Great Rune of your own and send Tarnished like assassins to kill King Godrick for his. Go back to your books, old man, leave me and my friends alone."

"Or what?"

"Or nothing. You're an honorable man, you should have better things to do than annoy people."

"You should know better than to antagonize me."

"Then don't give me reason to: don't insult my friends by calling them rabble. If we're both polite and courteous, there'll be no antagonizing, will there? And give my regards to your lovely daughter, should you meet her."

You get the sense that he glares at you from underneath his strange helm --- the edges of it are somehow adorned with sculpted ears.

"Very well." He turns and returns to his library.

"Strange fellow, that Gideon," Rogierre says beside you, causing you to jump. The man is dressed quite like your namesake, with pointed shoes, puffed sleeves, ribbons, and even a bell on his hate which you aren't quite sure how he managed not to jingle while sneaking up on you.

"Yeah, he is discourteous to me for some reason."

"I think he is to everyone, Jester."

"Well, he has more reason to than most, with me," you say. "I've bedded his daughter."

Rogierre chuckles. "Speaking of said daughter, you're part of the operation she's planning?"

"I am."

He offers his hand and you shake it. "Good. We'll be meeting up by then, she has hired me for my skills as a spellblade; and I'm stealthier than you think."

"I believe it."

"Dee and I are also hearing rumors there may be something amiss in the catacombs under Stormburg, to do with the living dead. He's a bit of a brute --- I can see why he likes someone as big and strong as your Nameless knight --- and I'm more of an investigator."

"Once King Godrick is dead, I'm sure Nameless and I can lend you a hand."

"Great!" he puts a hand on your shoulder. "Fia will be delighted to hear. She's very interested in my studies."

That gives you pause. "You're friends with Fia?"

"Yes, of course. She's quite a scholar in living death, greater even than myself."

"Okay, and also a serial murderess, if I understand things."

Rogierre withdraws his hand. "Well, we don't see eye-to-eye on many things, her and I. But she is still a valuable ally."

"I also think she's afraid of me. She gave me a hug and apparently I burned her, somehow."

He tilts his head. "Wait, that really happened? I assumed she'd just gone mad."

You hold up a hand and conjure a flame. "I'm apparently just really in tune with fire in all forms."

Rogierre nods. "Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Anyway, good to meet you. I'm heading back to Stormhill --- there's a catacomb there I'd like to spelunk."

"Could you just take me with you there for a moment? I haven't been to a hallow of Grace there."

"... Sure, come along."

He tosses a cloak over his shoulders and steps through the Grace above the table; you follow. It is a windy drizzle where you arrive, by a hallow down an escarpment from one end of a huge bridge.

You run your fingers through the golden light. "Thanks. And good luck spelunking."

Rogierre tips his hat and sets out up a path in the escarpment.

With the mote of Grace now held in your mind, you return to the Hold, where Boc and Titania are already heading down to Hewg's. You trot after.

"Why if it isn't Titania," Hewg says.

"Eyy!" Titania exclaims. "Old man Hewg! Good to see you again."

She hugs him like an old friend. A few times while you traveled, she would go off on her own, traveling through grace. You have been assuming she went to visit Gurranq and see to Morning as its Lord, but apparently she's also been coming here.

Hewg looks as well as he did when you left him --- shaven, barnacle free, and wearing some good clothes. "Hello there, Ezekiel. Good to see you again as well. Who's this?"

Boc takes off hat. "Hello, master Hewg, I'm Boc the Seamster."

"Why a fellow artisan. What do you need?"

"I don't know, a weapon of some sort. And I could use a new set of scissors and some knives. What do you got that's easy to kill with?"

Hewg looks at him. "How strong are you, boy?"

"Uh... good question."

Picking up his chain, Hewg throws it over one shoulder and heads over to the huge rack of ready-made weapons, picking out a war hatchet. "This one, I reckon should do you well. There's a magic in it --- intimidating stuff. Rage and raw violence and bellows like thunderclaps. Take care when you swing it in battle."

"Oh, hang on, I have a thing --- an ash --- that might go well with that," Titania says. "But I'm currently wearing it, so I'll give it to you later."

"I have no idea what that means," Boc says, "but I'll be thankful. What about armor? Maybe a shield?"

Hewg picks up a shield perfectly sized for Boc. "Ezekiel can show you the textile rooms, I'm sure a seamster like yourself can find something fitting, and I'll fit any armor you need adjusted."

----

You leave Roundtable Hold to head back to Fringefolk and purchase supplies for the next leg of your journey. It's a town you're already familiar with --- more so than Haft --- and they have a richer selection of wares, which Boc needs for his concoctions.

Torrent's saddlebags get stuffed with trail bread and pickled greens and and cookware, Squall's with a better tent and bedrolls. Boc's ghostly steed draws less attention than you might have guessed.

By your reckoning, you first came to the Lands Between somewhere on this coast, and it might be worth trying to find that place before you go to Stormhill. Riding out of town, someone takes note of you. A hillfolk woman standing taller even than Titania, dressed in clothes like the dockworkers.

"Boc?" she asks.

Boc doesn't react, riding on.

You look over your shoulder, and sees her looking after you. "_Is that you, Boc?_" she calls out.

Boc pulls the collar of his new coat up and pulls his tricorne hat down.

Pulling Torrent over next to him you ask: "Who's that?"

"Someone I have no desire to talk to."

Glancing over your shoulder you see that the woman has decided to follow you. You wave at Titania, snap your fingers, and point.

Titania hops off squall and gets in her way.

"What?" she asks.

"Get lost lady," Titania growls.

"_That's my son, there!_"

"And he doesn't wanna see you. _Get lost._"

The hillfolk woman raises a hand and Titania doesn't even flinch. Indeed she takes a step forward. "Go on. Hit me. See how that plays out for you. If you're lucky I'll let you pick your teeth up with only half your fingers broken."

Boc has his back turned to the whole debacle, and you put a hand on his shoulder.

"Curse you, fucking misbegotten whore. You're just stealing my son from me, aren't you?!"

Titania shoves her in the chest, hard enough to make her stumble, but it doesn't come to blows. Boc's mother sulks off, and Titania mounts up again.

"She had a charming personality," she mutters as you exit the city gates.

"Let's never go back here," Boc says.

-----

"I think this is enough meandering across the countryside," you say, as evening falls. You've made camp together as you usually do. Boc is braiding Titania's long red hair.

"What do you mean?" Titania asks.

"Just... we're going to be fighting a _war_ in a moon and a half. We've been helping Boc find his feet, but I think it's time we start thinking towards _really_ getting strong."

"Runes for strength," Boc says. "Or what?"

"Yeah. Which means we need to find several someones, strong enough to be worth a bounty, but not so strong that we'll be risking our hides."

"Drakes," Boc says. "Dragons --- well the ones like Agheel are called Drakes, it's only really the ancient ones that are called Dragons."

Titania turns her head a bit to look at him.

"We go back to lake agheel, we lure in a Drake and kill it."

"That went badly last time," you say.

"That was 'cause you didn't have me, Cully. And you didn't know how to kill it --- Yura was a real arse in not telling you. But it really is that simple: lure in a Drake with mutton and rotten wood, furl its wings, and stab it in the chin. With your fancy flying sword and Titania's strength, it'll be no problem. And we already know Agheel is going to come running, so we just get ready to book it --- and now we all have horses. It gets us a load of runes, and another heart for me."

He scratches at the mark of war ash on his neck. Titania swats at his hand.

"All right. We give it one more try, but if I get trampled by a dragon again, we're going to Stormhill immediately."

-----

Traveling through Grace you head back to Agheel Lake, arriving in the catacombs, and take care to circumnavigate it over the course of two days of preparation, finding several hallows of Grace along the way for quick travel, and a viable beach to stage the next ambush on.

Tracking down rotten wood is harder, here, but still you find a log. The wild goats are also sparser, but nothing Boc can't make short work of with your crossbow --- indeed it should probably be his crossbow, as he has begun fashioning bolts of sharpened bone and experimented with dipping them in venoms.

Lying in wait in holes in the ground is as boring as the first time, but true enough a drake does indeed come to scarf down the mutton and wood.

This time things happen much smoother. Titania sneaks out of cover and past the beast's tail, then leaps onto its back and with one swing of her terrible curved sword bites deep through the tough hide, into the enormous muscles that lets the drake lift up its wings. It cries out in pain, but Titania makes short work of the other wing, too, crippling the beast.

You spring out of cover and sprint for it. The drake opens its mouth to try to breathe fire at you, but receives a concussive blast of fire to the side of the head courtesy one of Boc's jars, giving you enough of an opening to get under its head and see the patch of soft tissue.

The blade of your sword sinks deep, and you have to roll out of the way to avoid being crushed by the falling head.

And then it is over. Barely thirty heartbeats. A bounty of runes comes to rest with you.

Titania lands in the sand beside you. "Holy shit."

"Yeah."

"That was easy."

"Disturbingly so."

Summoning each of your steeds, you make haste for a cover you identified ahead of time, under a great fallen tree. Agheel once more comes to mourn her dead young, while you give the whole bounty of runes to Titania.

Come nightfall, you return to the corpse to butcher it, Boc putting his new hatchet and knives to work and emerging not only with the enormous heart, but also a variety of tissues and glands he intends to experiment with.

You make camp after midnight at a hallow of Grace and call Melina.

"I have runes," Titania says, holding out a hand.

"For strength."

Melina takes Titania's hand and her eyes go wide. "What in all the Lands Between did you kill?"

"A drake," Boc says, carving up the heart of it, eating morsels of the raw flesh as he goes, throwing the tough bits to stew in a cooking pot, and pickling the tender ones in vinegar and brine. You cook a dinner for Titania and yourself on a separate fire.

"And we're going to do it again," you say.

Darkness and fire.

Butchery under the earth.

-----

The next two weeks you kill one drake after another, depopulating Agheel lake of flying menaces, until it is only Agheel herself left.

All three of you are swell with runes. The fire inside you burns deeper than it ever has. There's an inexplicable weight to every movement Titania makes, as if she could knock over mountains with a careless gesture. Boc has grown to twice his size already and the skin is starting to flake on parts of his face, though he assures you it's nothing to be afraid of.

"Should we try our hand at the big one herself?" you voice the question you're all thinking.

"I vote aye," Titania says.

"I vote aye as well," Boc says.

-----

The bounty of foods you lay out for Agheel is larger than ever --- fifteen heads of mutton, two logs of rotten wood that Titania has hauled into place with little effort.

Agheel, however, is a cunning beast, wary of the trap.

She lands and spends a while scouting for danger, walking about the bounty of foods. But eventually her beastly nature overcomes her caution and she gives into hunger. Unfortunately she has turned her back to _you,_ not Titania.

Still, you have accounted for this.

As one, the three of you spring into action. Boc first slings a jar of corrosive poison at Agheel's face, blinding her on one eye.

You leap from your hiding spot and sprint across the shingle beach, calling on fire to spur you, and form under your feet for a blast that propels you up in the air, landing on Agheel's thick scaly hide among the vicious spines. There you scamper up to its shoulders before she has a chance to realize you're there, too preoccupied with scratching at her face.

Bracing yourself against the spines, you hold on for dear life with an arm and a leg and put all your might and fire into your beloved sword, spinning it up into a mad whirlwind of fire and plunging it down into Agheel's shoulder, where it embeds itself to the pommel, drilling out a spray of gore and bone shards.

Immediately, the drake cries out in agony and tries to shake you off, but weakened by the loss of use of a limb, you narrowly manage to hold on. Having identified you as a threat on its back, she bends around her long neck, opening her maw and calling on her fire.

You hold out a hand and commands the fire to extinguish and deflect, and although an inferno comes, you're left unscathed --- not even singed.

Then Agheel shudders and goes limp, her great mass collapsing.

Leaping off the corpse and bidding your sword to leap from where it was embedded in the drake's shoulder bone, Titania comes over, wiping blood off her sword.

Boc comes over at a trot.

"Nice hit, Boc," Titania says. "Big blind spot let me get to her, easy as warm pie."

"Very clean bladework, Mate."

Then Titania turns to you. "Zeke, you okay? She spewed fire directly at you."

You flex the hand you held out a few times, feeling the remnants of power in your fingertips. The rosary bound around your wrist is starting to look sooty.

"You're not the only one who has gotten stronger," you say with a smile. "Let's get butchering."

-----

Four days later, you're going to Stormhill.

You get past Stormgate, through the grace that Rogierre provided you access to, and arrive in a full-on rainstorm. The escarpment Rogierre went up is a mudpit, but Titania calls on her mastery of the earth and does something to solidify it for the three of you to ascend.

Boc has fashioned you waterproof cloaks of drakeskin, and a sack for himself that somehow seems as much bigger on the inside as Torrent's and Squall's saddlebags.

Pulling your cloak closer about you, you scout in either direction of the road, one leading over the enormous bridge, the other leading --- by your reckoning --- east towards Stormburg.

"Out that-away, a day or two on foot, lies Summonwater," Titania says, pointing across the bridge. "Dee had a deathroot to winnow there."

"I know," you say. "I dreamt of it while I was traveling with Corhyn."

You each call on your steeds and head the other way, up towards Stormburg, along the road network in the forested hills, under towering arches of ancient bridges that once led somewhere grand, but now are in ruins. Their silhouettes are only barely visible against the grey skies.

"Don't you think we should seek some shelter, Cully?" Boc calls out. "Just for comfort?"

"And for safety," Titania says. "If we're beset, can you conjure flame in this weather, Zeke?"

"Let's find shelter," you agree.

Boc rides in front on his headless ghostly steed and leads you off the cobbled road down a muddy dirt path to a dilapidated shed --- perhaps once built for weary travelers to seek shelter in, but now barely fit for purpose.

And it is occupied.

In the driest corner sits a woman in besmirched noblewoman's whites, muddied boots, and a red, hooded mantle barely going past her shoulders. Her face is buried in her knees, and she's shivering with the cold.

"Pardon our intrusion, milady," you say, casting back your hood.

She startles and looks up at you with fear and tears in her eyes; a wonderfully pretty face with delicate features and blonde forelocks. "Oh thank goodness, I thought--- I thought..." she shakes her head and hides her face again. "Just leave me be."

You take off your helm, coif, and leather cap. "I'm afraid we're looking to seeking shelter here, milady. We mean you no harm."

Looking up again, the woman wipes her eyes with a gloved hand, smudging dirt on her cheek. "Sorry, of course. Far be it from me to demand privacy."

"It's quite alright. Allow is to make things comfortable." You wave Titania and Boc inside. "Boc, could you go nail one of the waxed tarps over the worse of the holes in the roof?"

"Sure, Cully," he says and takes off his cloak, handing it to you.

He pulls off his mail shirt and gambeson, sticking both in his sack and then taking hammer and nails from it. "But you better have a fire going so I can get dry," he says, pointing at you with the hammer. Then he heads outside to find a tarp in Squall's saddlebags.

"And Titania if you would fetch some food and drink?"

Titania leans in. "_What, smitten already?_"

"_She deserves kindness is all,_" you whisper back.

"_Sure she does._" Titania pats you on the shoulder and heads out into the rain again.

You head outside to the firepit and haul the stones out of the mud, bringing them inside the shed. The woman looks on with fascination as you unwrap the rosary from your hand and wrist, laying it in the center of the stone circle on the floor.

Then by your power, a flame appears in the middle of the room, as warm as any roaring fire, but spewing no sparks and belching no smoke. 

There's the sound of hammer strikes up on the roof as Boc works.

Your cloak, you take off and shake once, calling on heat to dry the hide completely in a gust of steam, then you lay it on the muddy floor to sit on. You do the same with Boc's cloak, then you go to the woman and offer her a hand. "Come get dry. Put your boots by the fire."

She takes your hand with wonder in her eyes and let you haul her up to stand. By the fire she puts her boots and sits on her knees, taking off her gloves to warm her hands.

Titania comes in with a keg of wine, a leg of mutton, a few jars of pickled fruits and one of rendered fat, dark bread, and your trusty skillet. "Here you are, Jester." She sets down the keg and the fruits on top. The mutton wrapped in linen she puts on Boc's cloak, and pan she spins like it was a weapon and hands it to you handle first.

You set it down on a little trio of stones off the side of the firepit, then you take Titania's cloak from her and dries it just the same as you did the others, laying it out to cover most of the circumference of the fire.

Boc comes in with his trousers, fur and hat quite soaked. "Pardon my undress, milady," he says.

"Oh, it's no trouble."

Finally, all three of you take a seat by the fire. "So," you say. "I'm Jester, this is Nameless, my Knight and Lord of Morne, and Boc the Seamster."

"Charmed; I'm Roðrika." She gives a little bow. "Wait--- Lord of Morne?"

"You know it?" Titania asks.

"Well, no, but if thou art a _Lord,_ and yet Knight for thee, Jester --- what manner of rank doest thou possess?"

"In this moment, none. One day? Elden Lord," you say.

Roðrika makes wide eyes. "Not many Tarnished are so bold," she mutters.

By your will, the skillet heats to cooking temperatures, and you take a glob of fat to cook by and start carving the mutton leg. "Well, I am. What's your story, lady Roðrika?"

Roðrika takes a deep breath. "I am the Baroness of Deenh. I came to the Lands Between heeding the call of Grace, same as you no doubt have. My great-grandmother Ruaiðríga for whom I am named, served with Lord Godfrey, and was banished same as he. She took Deenh as her fief, and it passed from mother to daughter for four generations until I left my family and took our finest men of arms to Ranah to sail across the Mists."

"You're from the Land of Glass?" You ask.

"Yes. Are you as well?"

"Down south in Ishe. But--- my _father_ served with Lord Godfrey. How---"

"Time passes yet differently in the Mists. How come you are not veiled? I thought women in Ishe covered their faces?"

"The Lands Between ain't the Land of Glass," Titania mutters. "An Elden Lord cannot bear a veil."

"Ah," Roðrika says.

"Pardon the interruption, continue your story." You turn the frying slivers of meat with your chopsticks.

She clears her throat. "We did not last long, here. Our provisions ran out, but when we starved, we didn't weaken. Then we met with a regiment of Godrick's forces and were taken captive... they took us to... to the city. And below it, where--- where---" She has to take a deep breath and calm herself.

You find the words for her, having seen it in a dream. "Godrick's chirurgeons. They grafted your men."

Roðrika nods mutely. "I--- I escaped. I left them all to their fates." She clutches handfuls of her skirt in balled fists and weeps quietly, "I'm nothing but a craven."

You reach over and put a hand on hers. "There's no shame in running away, Lady Roðrika. Myself and my companions, we have run from many a danger."

"_We have?_" Titania mutters.

She wipes her tears with a clean hand, this time, taking away the smudge of dirt.

"Tell you what," you continue, "and keep this _secret,_" you caution.

She nods.

"In a moon's time, a great force of soldiers will march on Stormgate and Stormburg's defenses, and myself, my companions, and a few other elite fighters will infiltrate the city and seek to put Godrick to the sword. If we can't save your men, at least we will avenge them."

The meat is done, and you pass the skillet around for Boc and Titania to skewer slices on their knives and wrap in bread. Boc drains a jar of pickles and passes that around as well. You make a wrap of meat for Roðrika, and one for yourself.

She takes the food and gives it a half-hearted nibble, looking into the fire. "I wish I could help."

"You've a spirit-caller bell on your belt," Boc points out.

You hadn't even noticed.

"What manner of spirit is in it?"

"Oh... A kind of... sea creature. I do not know precisely what, but she helped me escape, warding off the soldiers with her sting."

"Sounds like a fine companion," Boc says. "I've got a spirit myself, but she's just a headless horse. Quite the convenience."

Roðrika looks around at the three of you. "Who are you people, even? What are your stories?"

"I'm from Haft, down south. My mother was a terrible woman, and my sisters just as her. I met Jester and Titania after they had helped break a siege of Godrick's army's making. Jester beat the tar out of my sisters and took me with her. We've been touring the countryside since, and hunting drakes down by the lake to the south." Boc takes a bite of his bread and meat.

"I was born into slavery, runt of my litter, and escaped at a young age. I lived off thievery until I heard there had been a slave uprising in my home city, but I was scared to return. I met Jester; she gave me a sword and a purpose. We returned to Morning and I challenged the new lord, my brother, for the title and won. Then I spent two months studying with Gurranq the Beast, learning to hunt the Undead, then Jester and I went to Haft and found Boc." Titania finds four earthenware cups and hands out wine.

"I came here by boat five moons ago," you say. "All my travel companions died soon after we landed --- or so I thought, apparently at least one survived --- and I wandered the land aimlessly until I met Nameless. After she became Lord, I traveled with a holyman named Corhyn and learned I have a great skill at calling flame." You smile at Roðrika.

She smiles back, a beautiful smile. "You seem a strange little trio, very loyal to one another."

"There's a fourth of our number, if you could count her," Titania says. "You're Tarnished, Lady Roðrika, have you ever met Melina the Ghost? Red hair, appears from thin air in a swirl of ash?"

"Yes, I believe I might have. But only once. She asked me if I sought the Elden Ring."

"She asks that of everyone, I think," you say.

Though you wonder why she keeps doing it now that she has you.

-----

The rain lets up as evening falls. You've all gotten dry and sated, both of foods and of conversation. Titania has sharpened your weapons and is cleaning hers and your plate armor, Boc is tending to the inevitable tears in your clothes that travel produces.

You stand and gaze into the drenched forest. The smell of petrichor hangs heavy, and the glow of the Erdtree lights through the cloud cover.

"Roðrika, have you ever been to the Roundtable Hold?"

"No? What's that?"

You turn to her, sitting under a loaned wool cloak.

"It's a haven for Tarnished like us. Well, sort of a haven. You'll likely have to stay on guard, but it is safe from Godrick's men. I can show you how to go there."

She looks into the fire. "I'd appreciate that."

The three of you pack up the camp, stowing all your goods in Torrent's and Squall's saddlebags once more, and you put the stones back in the outdoors firepit where they belong.

Roðrika sits behind you on Torrent, holding around your waist like her life depends on it. You ride in between the trees to where you see Grace guiding you. Eventually you find a hallow by a half-collapsed cairn covered in moss.

Here you dismount and the four of you step through grace to the Roundtable Hold.
