# Fringefolk, Stormhill

Your journey west takes you to the ocean proper, and it becomes reality that you have crossed the breadth of Limgrave, from the insea to the outersea --- the horizon is wreathed in the fog you crossed to to arrive here in the Lands Between.

Out beyond it lies the Land of Glass, where you were born. The coastal city of Ishe, where your father took you to see the duke's men march in parade.

"One day, daughter mine, when you grow up, will you fight for the downtrodden?" you quote.

The ocean wind blows about the three of you.

"What's that, Cully?"

"Something my father asked me. I was too young to know what it meant, then. But... chimera, hillfolk, living jars... sure seems there's plenty of downtrodden to fight for."

"We have our work cut out for us," Titania agrees.

You follow the coast south for a day's ride, reaching Fringefolk. It is a mellow harbor town, with ships coming to and fro --- fishing vessels, trade vessels, and even warships. The houses have roves of tile rather than straw, and the streets are lively, seeming more prosperous than Haft, if smaller.

The reason for the apparent prosperity becomes clear once you reach the docks: slavery. Of hillfolk, chimera, and humans. You feel both Titania and Boc's rage. There's free hillfolk and chimera, too, but even just on your walk through the city has given you the impression that they are treated with less than dignity and respect.

But there is little to do. Soldiers and watchmen patrol the streets, and the banner of Godrick flies on the city walls and the masts of ships in harbor.

You negotiate passage on a ferry to the small isle out in the bay, and sail across the clear waters at noon. Titania stays with the boatman to make sure he doesn't slip away and leave you stranded.

Up on the highest point of the island is a circle of standing stones, and a basin carved in stone that burns with a dark flame --- one that feels familiar to you: the bloodflame. No trace of fuel for this fire is to be found.

A little down the hill is a shack, and before the eternal flame, sits a... man or woman, hard to tell. Visibly ancient and weathered, with long gray hair, in clothes that are old and worn.

"Hullo!" you call out. "Is this the church of the dragon cult?"

The old hermit rises from the paving stones. "Who comes to ask?"

"I am Jester, this is my friend Boc. He has eaten the heart of one of Agheel's brood. The traveling warrior Yura directed us here. He has gone north in search of the traitor Eleanora."

The hermit nods. "Yes, the Caelid chapter. I heard of that tragedy. Alas, I am all that is left of the faithful here. I am Johannae... Come let me see you, boy."

Boc trots over, and Johannae inspects his eyes. "Indeed, you are making fine way on the path of the Dragon."

"With respect, master Johannae, I am also a seamster. I could patch some of the holes in your robe while you teach me?"

-----

You spend the next few days taking the ferry back and forth to the island, letting Boc take lessons from Johannae.

The ferryman is a nice fellow by the name of Olaf, who has a wife and child, and is thankful for you providing him with easy work.

You spend your time on the island meditating on the nature of fire, while Titania spends her days practicing fishing. There's even a hallow of Grace on the island, and you take Melina for a stroll on the beach.

What Boc learns, he keeps fiercely secret, but after week's tutelage Johannae deems that Boc has learned all that he can, and sends you on your way.

You pay Olaf for the trip back, but remain on the island with Titania and Boc.

"Care to tell why you deliberately stranded us here, Cully?"

"There's a thing I need to know if you can learn." You lead the three of you to the hallow of Grace nestled in between the rocks on the beach.

With Titania's instruction, Boc takes to using the trick of the light, quite well. But same as her, he does not see the Guidance that leads you to effortlessly finding the hallows of Grace.

And then you take him to the Roundtable Hold.

-----

It's been over a moon since you've been here, but it seems much the same. Despondent Tarnished still sit along the floors and in the halls. Fia still likely stalks the halls in search of prey.

There's no sight of Brother Corhyn, but Dee is there, and Titania greets him like an old friend. He introduces the three of you to a sorcerer by the name of Rogierre.

And then Gideon Ofnir comes out of his library. You intercept him before he can approach where Titania is introducing Boc to Dee and Rogierre.

"Ah. I thought I heard a commotion. Prithee, Ezekiel Flamecaller, what rabble have you brought to the Hold this time?"

"It's of no concern of yours who I bring here, Gideon Ofnir."

"I should think _I_ get to decide that."

"Yes, because I am a mere 'visitor' while you hold a Great Rune of your own and send Tarnished like assassins to kill King Godrick for his. Go back to your books, old man, leave me and my friends alone."

"Or what?"

"Or nothing. You're an honorable man, you should have better things to do than annoy people."

"You should know better than to antagonize me."

"Then don't give me reason to: don't insult my friends by calling them rabble. If we're both polite and courteous, there'll be no antagonizing, will there? And give my regards to your lovely daughter, should you meet her."

You get the sense that he glares at you from underneath his strange helm --- the edges of it are somehow adorned with sculpted ears.

"Very well." He turns and returns to his library.

"Strange fellow, that Gideon," Rogierre says beside you, causing you to jump. The man is dressed quite like your namesake, with pointed shoes, puffed sleeves, ribbons, and even a bell on his hate which you aren't quite sure how he managed not to jingle while sneaking up on you.

"Yeah, he is discourteous to me for some reason."

"I think he is to everyone, Jester."

"Well, he has more reason to than most, with me," you say. "I've bedded his daughter."

Rogierre chuckles. "Speaking of said daughter, you're part of the operation she's planning?"

"I am."

He offers his hand and you shake it. "Good. We'll be meeting up by then, she has hired me for my skills as a spellblade; and I'm stealthier than you think."

"I believe it."

"Dee and I are also hearing rumors there may be something amiss in the catacombs under Stormburg, to do with the living dead. He's a bit of a brute --- I can see why he likes someone as big and strong as your Nameless knight --- and I'm more of an investigator."

"Once King Godrick is dead, I'm sure Nameless and I can lend you a hand."

"Great!" he pats you on the shoulder. "Fia will be delighted to hear. She's very interested in my studies."

That gives you pause. "You're friends with Fia?"
