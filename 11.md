# From Fringefolk to Stormhill

Your journey west takes you to the ocean proper, and it becomes reality that you have crossed the breadth of Limgrave, from the insea to the outersea --- the horizon is wreathed in the fog you crossed to to arrive here in the Lands Between.

Out beyond it lies the Land of Glass, where you were born. The coastal city of Ishe, where your father took you to see the duke's men march in parade.

"One day, daughter mine, when you grow up, will you fight for the downtrodden?" you quote.

The ocean wind blows about the three of you.

"What's that, Cully?"

"Something my father asked me. I was too young to know what it meant, then. But... chimera, hillfolk, living jars... sure seems there's plenty of downtrodden to fight for."

"We have our work cut out for us," Titania agrees.

You follow the coast south for a day's ride, reaching Fringefolk. It is a mellow harbor town, with ships coming to and fro --- fishing vessels, trade vessels, and even warships. The houses have roves of tile rather than straw, and the streets are lively, seeming more prosperous than Haft, if smaller.

The reason for the apparent prosperity becomes clear once you reach the docks: slavery. Of hillfolk, chimera, and humans. You feel both Titania and Boc's rage. There's free hillfolk and chimera, too, but even just on your walk through the city has given you the impression that they are treated with less than dignity and respect.

But there is little to do. Soldiers and watchmen patrol the streets, and the banner of Godrick flies on the city walls and the masts of ships in harbor.

You negotiate passage on a ferry to the small isle out in the bay, and sail across the clear waters at noon. Titania stays with the boatman to make sure he doesn't slip away and leave you stranded.

Up on the highest point of the island is a circle of standing stones, and a basin carved in stone that burns with a dark flame --- one that feels familiar to you: the bloodflame. No trace of fuel for this fire is to be found.

A little down the hill is a shack, and before the eternal flame, sits a... man or woman, hard to tell. Visibly ancient and weathered, with long gray hair, in clothes that are old and worn.

"Hullo!" you call out. "Is this the church of the dragon cult?"

The old hermit rises from the paving stones. "Who comes to ask?"

"I am Jester, this is my friend Boc. He has eaten the heart of one of Agheel's brood. The traveling warrior Yura directed us here. He has gone north in search of the traitor Eleanora."

The hermit nods. "Yes, the Caelid chapter. I heard of that tragedy. Alas, I am all that is left of the faithful here. I am Johannae... Come let me see you, boy."

Boc trots over, and Johannae inspects his eyes. "Indeed, you are making fine way on the path of the Dragon."

"With respect, master Johannae, I am also a seamster. I could patch some of the holes in your robe while you teach me?"

-----

You spend the next few days taking the ferry back and forth to the island, letting Boc take lessons from Johannae.

The ferryman is a nice fellow by the name of Olaf, who has a wife and child, and is thankful for you providing him with easy work.

You spend your time on the island meditating on the nature of fire, while Titania spends her days practicing fishing. There's even a hallow of Grace on the island, and you take Melina for a stroll on the beach.

What Boc learns, he keeps fiercely secret, but after week's tutelage Johannae deems that Boc has learned all that he can, and sends you on your way.

You pay Olaf for the trip back, but remain on the island with Titania and Boc.

"Care to tell why you deliberately stranded us here, Cully?"

"There's a thing I need to know if you can learn." You lead the three of you to the hallow of Grace nestled in between the rocks on the beach.

With Titania's instruction, Boc takes to using the trick of the light, quite well. But same as her, he does not see the Guidance that leads you to effortlessly finding the hallows of Grace.

And then you take him to the Roundtable Hold.

-----

It's been over a moon since you've been here, but it seems much the same. Despondent Tarnished still sit along the floors and in the halls. Fia still likely stalks the halls in search of prey.

There's no sight of Brother Corhyn, but Dee is there, and Titania greets him like an old friend. He introduces the three of you to a sorcerer by the name of Rogierre.

And then Gideon Ofnir comes out of his library. You intercept him before he can approach where Titania is introducing Boc to Dee and Rogierre.

"Ah. I thought I heard a commotion. Prithee, Ezekiel Flamecaller, what rabble have you brought to the Hold this time?"

"It's of no concern of yours who I bring here, Gideon Ofnir."

"I should think _I_ get to decide that."

"Yes, because I am a mere 'visitor' while you hold a Great Rune of your own and send Tarnished like assassins to kill King Godrick for his. Go back to your books, old man, leave me and my friends alone."

"Or what?"

"Or nothing. You're an honorable man, you should have better things to do than annoy people."

"You should know better than to antagonize me."

"Then don't give me reason to: don't insult my friends by calling them rabble. If we're both polite and courteous, there'll be no antagonizing, will there? And give my regards to your lovely daughter, should you meet her."

You get the sense that he glares at you from underneath his strange helm --- the edges of it are somehow adorned with sculpted ears.

"Very well." He turns and returns to his library.

"Strange fellow, that Gideon," Rogierre says beside you, causing you to jump. The man is dressed quite like your namesake, with pointed shoes, puffed sleeves, ribbons, and even a bell on his hate which you aren't quite sure how he managed not to jingle while sneaking up on you.

"Yeah, he is discourteous to me for some reason."

"I think he is to everyone, Jester."

"Well, he has more reason to than most, with me," you say. "I've bedded his daughter."

Rogierre chuckles. "Speaking of said daughter, you're part of the operation she's planning?"

"I am."

He offers his hand and you shake it. "Good. We'll be meeting up by then, she has hired me for my skills as a spellblade; and I'm stealthier than you think."

"I believe it."

"Dee and I are also hearing rumors there may be something amiss in the catacombs under Stormburg, to do with the living dead. He's a bit of a brute --- I can see why he likes someone as big and strong as your Nameless knight --- and I'm more of an investigator."

"Once King Godrick is dead, I'm sure Nameless and I can lend you a hand."

"Great!" he puts a hand on your shoulder. "Fia will be delighted to hear. She's very interested in my studies."

That gives you pause. "You're friends with Fia?"

"Yes, of course. She's quite a scholar in living death, greater even than myself."

"Okay, and also a serial murderess, if I understand things."

Rogierre withdraws his hand. "Well, we don't see eye-to-eye on many things, her and I. But she is still a valuable ally."

"I also think she's afraid of me. She gave me a hug and apparently I burned her, somehow."

He tilts his head. "Wait, that really happened? I assumed she'd just gone mad."

You hold up a hand and conjure a flame. "I'm apparently just really in tune with fire in all forms."

Rogierre nods. "Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Anyway, good to meet you. I'm heading back to Stormhill --- there's a catacomb there I'd like to spelunk."

"Could you just take me with you there for a moment? I haven't been to a hallow of Grace there."

"... Sure, come along."

He tosses a cloak over his shoulders and steps through the Grace above the table; you follow. It is raining and windy where you arrive, by a hallow down an escarpment from one end of a huge bridge.

You run your fingers through the golden light. "Thanks. And good luck spelunking."

Rogierre tips his hat and sets out up a path in the escarpment.

With the mote of Grace now held in your mind, you return to the Hold, where Boc and Titania are already heading down to Hewg's. You trot after.

"Why if it isn't Titania," Hewg says.

"Eyy!" Titania exclaims. "Old man Hewg! Good to see you again."

She hugs him like an old friend. A few times while you traveled, she would go off on her own, traveling through grace. You have been assuming she went to visit Gurranq and see to Morning as its Lord, but apparently she's also been coming here.

Hewg looks as well as he did when you left him --- shaven, barnacle free, and wearing some good clothes. "Hello there, Ezekiel. Good to see you again as well. Who's this?"

Boc takes off hat. "Hello, master Hewg, I'm Boc the Seamster."

"Why a fellow artisan. What do you need?"

"I don't know, a weapon of some sort. And I could use a new set of scissors. What do you got that's easy to kill with?"

Hewg looks at him. "How strong are you, boy?"

"Uh... good question."

Picking up his chain, Hewg throws it over one shoulder and heads over to the huge rack of ready-made weapons, picking out a war hatchet. "This one, I reckon should do you well. There's a magic in it --- intimidating stuff. Rage and raw violence and bellows like thunderclaps. Take care when you swing it in battle."

"Oh, hang on, I have a thing --- an ash --- that might go well with that," Titania says. "But I'm currently wearing it, so I'll give it to you later."

"I have no idea what that means," Boc says, "but I'll be thankful. What about armor? Maybe a shield?"

Hewg picks up a shield perfectly sized for Boc. "Ezekiel can show you the textile rooms, I'm sure a seamster like yourself can find something fitting, and I'll fit any armor you need adjusted."

----

You leave Roundtable Hold to head back to Fringefolk and purchase supplies for the next leg of your journey. It's a town you're already familiar with --- more so than Haft --- and they have a richer selection of wares, which Boc needs for his concoctions.

Torrent's saddlebags get stuffed with trail bread and pickled greens and and cookware, Squall's with a better tent and bedrolls. Boc's ghostly steed draws less attention than you might have guessed.

By your reckoning, you first came to the Lands Between somewhere on this coast, and it might be worth trying to find that place before you go to Stormhill. Riding out of town, someone takes note of you. A hillfolk woman standing taller even than Titania, dressed in clothes like the dockworkers.

"Boc?" she asks.

Boc doesn't react, riding on.

You look over your shoulder, and sees her looking after you. "_Is that you, Boc?_" she calls out.

Boc pulls the collar of his new coat up and pulls his tricorne hat down.

Pulling Torrent over next to him you ask: "Who's that?"

"Someone I have no desire to talk to."

Glancing over your shoulder you see that the woman has decided to follow you. You wave at Titania, snap your fingers, and point.

Titania hops off squall and gets in her way.

"What?" she asks.

"Get lost lady," Titania growls.

"_That's my son, there!_"

"And he doesn't wanna see you. _Get lost._"

The hillfolk woman raises a hand and Titania doesn't even flinch. Indeed she takes a step forward. "Go on. Hit me. See how that plays out for you. If you're lucky I'll let you pick your teeth up with only half your fingers broken."

Boc has his back turned to the whole debacle, and you put a hand on his shoulder.

"Curse you, fucking misbegotten whore. You're just stealing my son from me, aren't you?!"

Titania shoves her in the chest, hard enough to make her stumble, but it doesn't come to blows. Boc's mother sulks off, and Titania mounts up again.

"She had a charming personality," she mutters as you exit the city gates.

"Let's never go back here," Boc says.

-----

"I think this is enough meandering across the countryside," you say, as evening falls. You've made camp together as you usually do. Boc is braiding Titania's hair.

"What do you mean?" Titania asks.

"Just... we're going to be fighting a _war_ in a moon and a half. We've been helping Boc find his feet, but I think it's time we start thinking towards _really_ getting strong."

"Runes for strength," Boc says. "Or what?"

"Yeah. Which means we need to find several someones, strong enough to be worth a bounty, but not so strong that we'll be risking our hides."

"Drakes," Boc says. "Dragons --- well the ones like Agheel are called Drakes, it's only really the ancient ones that are called Dragons."

Titania turns her head a bit to look at him.

"We go back to lake agheel, we lure in a Drake and kill it."

"That went badly last time," you say.

"That was 'cause you didn't have me, Cully. And you didn't know how to kill it --- Yura was a real arse in not telling you. But it really is that simple: lure in a Drake with mutton and rotten wood, furl its wings, and stab it in the chin. With your fancy flying sword and Titania's strength, it'll be no problem. And we already know Agheel is going to come running, so we just get ready to book it --- and now we all have horses. It gets us a load of runes, and another heart for me."

He scratches at the mark of war ash on his neck. Titania swats at his hand.

"All right. We give it one more try, but if I get trampled by a dragon again, we're going to Stormhill immediately."

-----

Traveling through Grace you head back to Agheel lake, arriving in the catacombs, and take care to circumnavigate it over the course of two days of preparation, finding several hallows of Grace
