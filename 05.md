# Guests

The speaker is a man in ornate armor, holding a staff. His voice betrays venerable age.

"Good day to you as well, sir," you say.

"As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard --- this place is under divine sanctuary, no blood may be spilt."

"Good to know, sir..."

"Ofnir, Gideon. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep."

"I'll be happy to accept but meagre hospitality."

"You may be at your leisure, but remember your place." He looks to Titania. "And who is this?"

"My knight, the Lord of Morne," you say continue before he can ask questions: "What distinguishes yourself, ser Ofnir, from a mere houseguest like myself?"

"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?"

"More at your condescension and the fact that you have not so much as bothered to ask me my name out of courtesy."

"Hm. You would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you. Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord."

"Yes, yes. Get to the point."

"If those words held any meaning to you: follow the guidance of grace, lay low the bearers of the Great Runes, and claim one for yourself. Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open, and you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers."

You lean over to Titania and wave her down to you. She bends to listen and you whisper very quietly: "_This guy is so full of himself he's about to burst._"

Titania nods solemnly.

"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.
As a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you".

"The feeling is not mutual."

He looks about. "I'm sick and tired of them. These spineless Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain... We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to".

"I rather think you have been doing most of the speaking. Be on your way, then."

He turns and leaves, through one of the six gateways around the perimeter of the room.

"Yep," Titania says. "Full. Of. Himself." She speaks loudly enough that there is no way Gideon did not hear.

There's several other people --- Tarnished all --- sitting in chairs or against the walls, some standing. A few of them are looking your way, probably wondering what a seven foot tall red-maned chimera is doing here.

You care not. "Let's split up and talk to people."

Titania pats you on the shoulder in agreement and you prowl in opposite directions around the absurdly enormous table in the center. Most people here are content to vehemently ignore you, but one man stands out. He is dressed in a clean yellow robe, a pair of dirty boots, and a strip of translucent gauze over his eyes. His hood is up, he's a curved blade in his belt, a cane laid out over the armrests of his chair, and an elaborate rosary in one hand. A holyman.

"Welcome to the Roundtable Hold," he says as you approach.

"Thank you."

"I am Corhyn, a traveling man of the cloth."

"I gathered. Call me Jester."

"You stand out, madame Jester. Your companion, especially."

You shrug. "We travel the land and get ourselves into trouble. What do you do?"

"I travel the land and teach. Tell me, do you see the guidance of grace?"

"I do."

"Wonderful news. So do I. Most of our kind are blind to it, these days. It also means I might be able to teach you, if you are looking for a master."

"In what?"

"Miracle working. For a price, of course." He holds out a hand and conjures from it a moment of light, and swirling tendrils of it, forming into delicate stems of plant matter, before they wither away. "No great theurge am I, but sometimes all you need is a good introductory teacher. You strike me as one who has faith."

You nod. "I'm inclined to take you up on that."

"But for now, go sate your curiosity. I'll rest here a while, before I leave. You are welcome to join me in the road."

You bow and head onwards. Titania is talking to a man in strange yellow-lustre armor at the other side of the table. One of the six gates leads to a balcony overlooking what you assume is an entry hall, with stairs down on either side. Down there sit a few more people, and there's great big doors on either side, leading to other chambers.

The opposite side of the table has its gate lead to a staircase up, and up to a set of double doors, sensibly shut. You take a guess that there beyond is the inner chamber, and the Two Fingers, whatever they may be. You call that north, so the entry hall is south.

Next you explore the west wing through the northwest gate, finding two levels of bedchambers, drawing rooms, lumber rooms, textile rooms, and... a room dedicated to a pile of corpses, slowly mummifying.

Through the southwest gate you find a banquet hall and a kitchen downstairs with an expansive pantry, root cellar, and wine cellar, and even a well. Going further you find an abattoir and utility room adjacent to the kitchen, and these connecting to an entry hall with an adjoining _stable._ Unused, of course --- the hay has turned to dust.

You're quite sure there's no way that these rooms could exist thusly without opening to one another.

The northeast wing leads to a grand library the likes of which you have never seen, two storeys of it. You spy ser Ofnir perusing the volumes. There's a few others, too, but Gideon seems to be the head librarian.

Last, you head into the southeast, and hear the sound of labor. A hammer striking steel. Perhaps here is a smith of great skill like Blaidd spoke of. There's steps of stone down to the work floor, and great furnaces and machines sit there; at the far end of the room a gate to the outside --- if there even is such a thing. Off to one side is a vast armory of all manner of weaponry imaginable.

There is but one man at work.

A chimera. The feather-fur on his arms is singed, and his callouses have callouses. There's horns and other growths --- barnacle-like --- on his head, and he mumbles to himself as he works. Heating steel to smith it.

And you see the the collar of black steel, and the chain hung from the ceiling.

A slave.

He stops for a moment and rests both elbows on his anvil. "_Your divinity, have mercy, and grand me forgiveness. The work is yet long; a God is not easily felled. With time, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika._"

Then he resumes muttering, picking up the tongs and pulling hot steel from the fire, selecting a suitable hammer, and begins the work.

You step out of the shadows and approach.

"Hullo, a new arrival?"

"Who are you?" you ask.

"Master weapon smith of the Roundtable. Name is Hewg. No matter, it's all the same. Lay out your arms, or chose from the stock."

"You're chained to the ceiling --- are you a slave?"

"Nothing special. I'm trapped in this forge by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. That's all there is to it." He looks at you with a piercing, wise stare. "Don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against any of you --- my being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind the work of a smith, and the work helps me forget... _her._"

You feel a terrible rage rise within you. "How long have you been here?"

"I don't know. It's no matter. Either give me work, or give me peace, girl."

"Master Hewg---"

"Nay. I've seen your sort many times, Tarnished. Soft-hearted ones that insist I should be freed. They rarely last long --- some fall into despair and sit around until the end of days. Some seek solace in Fia's arms o'er in her bedchambers. Some leave to wander and never return. I remain a prisoner."

You come up to him. "I'm sure you have, Master Hewg. Can you keep a secret?"

"I care not enough to share any I hear."

You lean on his anvil with both hands.

"My name is Ezekiel. My Shadow is called Titania --- she's a Chimera like you. I am chosen not by Grace but by the Two Fingers, an Empyrean like that Queen Marika to whom you pray for forgiveness..."

You think for a moment, finding the words.

"When I say I will see you freed from bondage, take it with the same surety as when the Queen imprisoned you here and set you to forge a weapon that could kill her."

He looks at you for a long while. Then he pulls steel from the furnace. "Move."

You take your hands off his anvil, and he goes to work.

"Don't speak like that to me again. Lay out your arms, chose something from the armory, or leave."

You oblige his request and leave the way you came.

It was a guess, but apparently a true one. Queen Marika herself imprisoned this man here to labor forever at creating a weapon that can kill a god: herself. Another mystery.

----

Heading back up to the round table, you find Titania still conversing with the man in the strange armor. You come up to her.

"Jester, this is Dee; Dee, this is my friend, Jester."

"Charmed," you say. "Nameless, a word?"

You pull her aside, over by the fireplace.

"_Listen, down in the armory, they have a chimera chained up._" You immediately put a hand on her arm. "_Calm down._"

"_I am calm. Angry, but calm._"

"_I think it was_ Queen Marika _who chained him up there. And he's in a forge --- something is preventing him from simply cutting the chain with his tools._"

"_We're still going to break him out, right?_"

"_Absolutely._"

Titania pats you on the back. "_While we figure that out, Dee is trying to recruit us to help clean out a 'living dead' problem in Limgrave. He serves an order led by a beast named Gurranq, and they're hurting for manpower._"

"_What's in it for us?_"

"_Allies, resources, introduction to this Gurranq who grants gifts to his followers. I'm interested, at the very least._"

"_Good. I spoke to the holyman, Corhyn, he claims to be able to teach miracle working._"

"_You're interested._"

"_Yes._"

"_Then let's split up. Dee is going scouting, I'll join him, earn an introduction._"

You blink at that suggestion.

"_Can you make your way back here?_"

"_I'm thinking: if I'm your Shadow, why shouldn't I be able to do all the Grace things in your stead also?_"

"_Let's find that out._"
