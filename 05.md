# Guests

The speaker is a man in ornate armor, holding a staff. His voice betrays venerable age.

"Good day to you as well, sir," you say.

"As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard --- this place is under divine sanctuary, no blood may be spilt."

"Good to know, sir..."

"Ofnir, Gideon. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep."

"I'll be happy to accept but meagre hospitality."

"Remember your place, newcomer. There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure."

He looks to Titania. "And who is this?"

"My knight, Titania, Lord of Morne," you say continue before he can ask questions: "What distinguishes yourself, ser Ofnir, from a mere houseguest like myself?"

"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?"

"More at your condescension and the fact that you have not so much as bothered to ask me my name out of courtesy."

"Hm. You would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you. Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord."

"Yes, yes. Get to the point."

"If those words held any meaning to you...
Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the bearers of the Great Runes, and claim one for yourself. Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open, and you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers."

You lean over to Titania and wave her down to you. She bends to listen and you whisper very quietly: "_This guy is so full of himself he's about to burst._"

Titania nods solemnly.

"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.
As a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you".

"The feeling is not mutual."

"I'm sick and tired of them. These spineless Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain... We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to".

"I rather think you have been doing most of the speaking. Be on your way, then."

He turns and leaves, through one of the six gateways in the room.

"Yep," Titania says. "Full. Of. Himself."
