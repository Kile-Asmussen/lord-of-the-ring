# Guests

The speaker is a man in ornate armor, holding a staff. His voice betrays venerable age.

"Good day to you as well, sir," you say.

"As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard --- this place is under divine sanctuary, no blood may be spilt." He points up towards the ceiling and you look, spotting a golden circle hung up above the enormous Grace. "That Rune ensures it."

"Good to know, sir..."

"Ofnir, Gideon. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep."

"I'll be happy to accept but meagre hospitality."

"You may be at your leisure, but remember your place." He looks to Titania. "And who is this?"

"My knight, the Lord of Morne," you say continue before he can ask questions: "What distinguishes yourself, ser Ofnir, from a mere houseguest like myself?"

"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?"

"More at your condescension and the fact that you have not so much as bothered to ask me my name out of courtesy."

"Hm. You would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you. Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord."

"Yes, yes. Get to the point."

"If those words held any meaning to you: follow the guidance of grace, lay low the bearers of the Great Runes, and claim one for yourself. Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open, and you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers."

You lean over to Titania and wave her down to you. She bends to listen and you whisper very quietly: "_This guy is so full of himself he's about to burst._"

Titania nods solemnly.

"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.
As a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you".

"The feeling is not mutual."

He looks about. "I'm sick and tired of them. These spineless Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain... We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to".

"I rather think you have been doing most of the speaking. Be on your way, then."

He turns and leaves, through one of the six gateways around the perimeter of the room.

"Yep," Titania says. "Full. Of. Himself." She speaks loudly enough that there is no way Gideon did not hear.

There's several other people --- Tarnished all --- sitting in chairs or against the walls, some standing. A few of them are looking your way, probably wondering what a seven foot tall red-maned chimera is doing here.

You care not. "Let's split up and talk to people."

Titania pats you on the shoulder in agreement and you prowl in opposite directions around the absurdly enormous table in the center. Most people here are content to vehemently ignore you, but one man stands out. He is dressed in a clean yellow robe, a pair of dirty boots, and a strip of translucent gauze over his eyes. His hood is up, he's a curved blade in his belt, a cane laid out over the armrests of his chair, and an elaborate rosary in one hand. A holyman.

"Welcome to the Roundtable Hold," he says as you approach.

"Thank you."

"I am Brother Corhyn, a traveling man of the cloth."

"I gathered. Call me Jester."

"You stand out, madame Jester. Your companion, especially."

You shrug. "We travel the land and get ourselves into trouble. What do you do?"

"I travel the land and teach. Tell me, do you see the guidance of grace?"

"I do."

"Wonderful news. So do I. Most of our kind are blind to it, these days. It also means I might be able to teach you, if you are looking for a master."

"In what?"

"Miracle working. For a price, of course." He holds out a hand and conjures from it a moment of light, and swirling tendrils of it, forming into delicate stems of plant matter, before they wither away. "No great theurge am I, but sometimes all you need is a good introductory teacher. You strike me as one who has faith."

You nod. "I'm inclined to take you up on that."

"But for now, go sate your curiosity. I'll rest here a while, before I leave. You are welcome to join me in the road."

You bow and head onwards. Titania is talking to a man in strange yellow-lustre armor at the other side of the table. One of the six gates leads to a balcony overlooking what you assume is an entry hall, with stairs down on either side. Down there sit a few more people, and there's great big doors on either side, leading to other chambers.

The opposite side of the table has its gate lead to a staircase up, and up to a set of double doors, sensibly shut. You take a guess that there beyond is the inner chamber, and the Two Fingers, whatever they may be. You call that north, so the entry hall is south.

Next you explore the west wing through the northwest gate, finding two levels of bedchambers, drawing rooms, lumber rooms, textile rooms, and... a room dedicated to a pile of corpses, slowly mummifying.

Through the southwest gate you find a banquet hall and a kitchen downstairs with an expansive pantry, root cellar, and wine cellar, and even a well. Going further you find an abattoir and utility room adjacent to the kitchen, and these connecting to an entry hall with an adjoining _stable._ Unused, of course --- the hay has turned to dust.

You're quite sure there's no way that these rooms could exist thusly without opening to one another.

The northeast wing leads to a grand library the likes of which you have never seen, two storeys of it. You spy ser Ofnir perusing the volumes. There's a few others, too, but Gideon seems to be the head librarian.

Last, you head into the southeast, and hear the sound of labor. A hammer striking steel. Perhaps here is a smith of great skill like Blaidd spoke of. There's steps of stone down to the work floor, and great furnaces and machines sit there; at the far end of the room a gate to the outside --- if there even is such a thing. Off to one side is a vast armory of all manner of weaponry imaginable.

There is but one man at work.

A chimera. The feather-fur on his arms is singed, and his callouses have callouses. There's horns and other growths --- barnacle-like --- on his head, and he mumbles to himself as he works. Heating steel to smith it.

And you see the the collar of black steel, and the chain hung from the ceiling.

A slave.

He stops for a moment and rests both elbows on his anvil. "_Your divinity, have mercy, and grand me forgiveness. The work is yet long; a God is not easily felled. With time, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika._"

Then he resumes muttering, picking up the tongs and pulling hot steel from the fire, selecting a suitable hammer, and begins the work.

You step out of the shadows and approach.

"Hullo, a new arrival?"

"Who are you?" you ask.

"Master weapon smith of the Roundtable. Name is Hewg. No matter, it's all the same. Lay out your arms, or chose from the stock."

"You're chained to the ceiling --- are you a slave?"

"Nothing special. I'm trapped in this forge by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. That's all there is to it." He looks at you with a piercing, wise stare. "Don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against any of you --- my being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind the work of a smith, and the work helps me forget... _her._"

You feel a terrible rage rise within you. "How long have you been here?"

"I don't know. It's no matter. Either give me work, or give me peace, girl."

"Master Hewg---"

"Nay. I've seen your sort many times, Tarnished. Soft-hearted ones that insist I should be freed. They rarely last long --- some fall into despair and sit around until the end of days. Some seek solace in Fia's arms o'er in her bedchambers. Some leave to wander and never return. I remain a prisoner."

You come up to him. "I'm sure you have, Master Hewg. Can you keep a secret?"

"I care not enough to share any I hear."

You lean on his anvil with both hands.

"My name is Ezekiel. My Shadow is called Titania --- she's a Chimera like you. I am chosen not by Grace but by the Two Fingers, an Empyrean like that Queen Marika to whom you pray for forgiveness..."

You think for a moment, finding the words.

"When I say I will see you freed from bondage, take it with the same surety as when the Queen imprisoned you here and set you to forge a weapon that could kill her."

He looks at you for a long while. Then he pulls steel from the furnace. "Move."

You take your hands off his anvil, and he goes to work.

"Don't speak like that to me again. Lay out your arms, chose something from the armory, or leave."

You oblige his request and unsling your sword from your back. With a whistle, Torrent obligingly appears --- even here --- and you retrieve the somber stone from his saddlebag. "This is my father's sword, and a stone I was given --- I was told a skilled smith would know what to do with them."

Hewg puts the iron he is working aside, he accepts the stone, inspecting it. "Touched by dragonfire. Rare specimen." He puts it down and draws your sword --- his arm span so long it is more like drawing a shortsword to him. "Fine blade. Well maintained. Good balance. Needs re-hardening of the edge and re-hilting. You will have your blade ready and imbued in a strike of the bell."

"How many of those in a day and night?"

"Twelve."

You take out a little bauble of runes to pay him.

"No matter. I take no payment."

You leave him to his work and it with him, without a word.

It was a guess, but apparently a true one. Queen Marika herself imprisoned this man here to labor forever at creating a weapon that can kill a god: herself. Another mystery.

----

Heading back up to the round table, you find Titania still conversing with the man in the strange armor --- same as the other times you came by her. You come up to her.

"Jester, this is Dee; Dee, this is my friend, Jester."

"Charmed," you say. "Nameless, a word?"

You pull her aside, over by the fireplace.

"_Listen, down in the armory, they have a chimera chained up._" You immediately put a hand on her arm. "_Calm down._"

"_I am calm. Angry, but calm._"

"_I think it was_ Queen Marika _who chained him up there. And he's in a forge --- something is preventing him from simply cutting the chain with his tools._"

"_We're still going to break him out, right?_"

"_Absolutely._"

Titania pats you on the back. "_While we figure that out, Dee is trying to recruit us to help clean out a 'living dead' problem in Limgrave. He serves an order led by a beast named Gurranq, and they're hurting for manpower._"

"_What's in it for us?_"

"_Allies, resources, introduction to this Gurranq who grants gifts to his followers. I'm interested, at the very least._"

"_Good. I spoke to the holyman, Corhyn, he claims to be able to teach miracle working._"

"_You're interested._"

"_Yes._"

"_Then let's split up. Dee is going scouting, I'll join him, earn an introduction._"

You blink at that suggestion.

"_Can you make your way back here?_"

"_I'm thinking: if I'm your Shadow, why shouldn't I be able to do all the Grace things in your stead also?_"

"_Let's find that out._"

-----

It takes Titania rather shorter a time to figure out than it did you. Helping no doubt was it that she could watch you do it. She takes the two of you from the church where you met Kalé to the Roundtable Hold, sealing the soundness of th plan. Squall comes when called by her as well. You make a mental note to procure more raisins.

"Now you take care of yourself," you say quietly to her. "Don't do anything stupid, and if you get hurt---" you press the little golden flask into her hand.

"Really?" she asks.

"You're going off to fight the living dead. I'm just going on a hike. Besides, Melina says she can brew another if I find the ingredients."

She takes it and spirits it away in her pocket. Then she puts her gentle hands on your shoulders and puts her forehead to yours. "You take care too, right?"

"I promise."

Then she goes with Dee through the enormous shard of Grace above the table. You head to Corhyn, who seems to have fallen asleep. It's a wonder you have yet to stumble over any of the wretches sitting on the floor --- some of them look positively emaciated.

"Brother Corhyn?"

He looks up at you. "Ah, Jester. Did you sate your curiosity about the Hold?"

"Mostly. I've left my sword to be worked on by Master Hewg, he will have it ready in about a bell."

"That misbegotten, are they your lover?"

"She strongly prefers 'chimera' and no. She is my very, very close friend. My heart beats for another."

"My pardons. I've never heard them referred to as 'chimera' before."

"Down south in the city of Morning, they do so. Nameless is the Lord, there, and the court is all chimeric. There was a slave rebellion, which overthrew the human Lord."

"I see. It may be heresy but I think it is an injustice that chimera do not have a place in the Erdtree's light. Your friend seems very virtuous."

"I shall convey the compliment to her."

-----

While you wait, you explore the library for a while, perusing the notes written on scraps of parchment nailed to each shelf. _Histories of the third through seventh intermittence,_ one reads.

There is an utter fortune in books here.

Apart from Gideon sitting at the central table, reading, a man in full armor is standing guard --- for what reason you can't imagine --- and his visor is in the image a skull.

A dark-skinned woman with pearls braided into her long dark hair is sorting books. She wears a finely embroidered doublet and a wolf pelt around her waist. Captivatingly fair. You make a note to get acquainted.
