# Making an Upsetting Acquaintance

The speaker is a man in ornate armor, holding a staff. His voice betrays venerable age.

"Good day to you as well, sir," you say.

"As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard --- this place is under divine sanctuary, no blood may be spilt." He points up towards the ceiling and you look, spotting a golden circle hung up above the enormous Grace. "That Rune ensures it."

"Good to know, sir..."

"Ofnir, Gideon. Allow me a word of advice, as your senior. You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more. A house guest, yet to earn their keep."

"I'll be happy to accept but meagre hospitality."

"You may be at your leisure, but remember your place." He looks to Titania. "And who is this?"

"My knight, the Lord of Morne," you say and continue before he can ask questions: "What distinguishes yourself, ser Ofnir, from a mere houseguest like myself?"

"Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?"

"More at your condescension and the fact that you have not so much as bothered to ask me my name out of courtesy."

"Hm. You would do well to remember the first words of Grace given to you. Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord."

"Yes, yes. Get to the point."

"If those words held any meaning to you: follow the guidance of Grace, lay low the bearers of the Great Runes, and claim one for yourself --- like I have. Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open, and you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers."

You lean over to Titania and wave her down to you. She bends to listen and you whisper very quietly: "_This guy is so full of himself he's about to burst._"

Titania nods solemnly.

"Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome. As a true member of the Roundtable. I have high hopes for you".

"The feeling is not mutual."

He looks about. "I'm sick and tired of them. These spineless Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain... We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to".

"I rather think you have been doing most of the speaking. Be on your way, then."

He turns and leaves, through one of the six gateways around the perimeter of the room.

"Yep," Titania says. "Full. Of. Himself." She speaks loudly enough that there is no way Gideon did not hear.

There's several other people --- Tarnished all --- sitting in chairs or against the walls, some standing. A few of them are looking your way, probably wondering what a seven foot tall red-maned chimera is doing here.

You care not. "Let's split up and talk to people."

Titania pats you on the shoulder in agreement and you prowl in opposite directions around the absurdly enormous table in the center. Most people here are content to vehemently ignore you, but one man stands out. He is dressed in a clean yellow robe, a pair of dirty boots, and a strip of translucent gauze over his eyes. His hood is up, he's a curved blade in his belt, a cane laid out over the armrests of his chair, and an elaborate rosary in one hand. A holyman.

"Welcome to the Roundtable Hold," he says as you approach.

"Thank you."

"I am Brother Corhyn, a traveling man of the cloth."

"I gathered. Call me Jester."

"You stand out, madame Jester. Your companion, especially."

You shrug. "We travel the land and get ourselves into trouble. What do you do?"

"I travel the land and teach. Tell me, do you see the guidance of Grace?"

"I do."

"Wonderful news. So do I. Most of our kind are blind to it, these days. It also means I might be able to teach you, if you are looking for a master."

"In what?"

"Miracle working. For a price, of course." He holds out a hand and conjures from it a moment of light, and swirling tendrils of it, forming into delicate stems of plant matter, before they wither away. "No great theurge am I, but sometimes all you need is a good introductory teacher. You strike me as one who has faith."

You nod. "I'm inclined to take you up on that."

"But for now, go sate your curiosity. I'll rest here a while, before I leave. You are welcome to join me in the road."

You bow and head onwards. Titania is talking to a man in strange yellow-lustre armor at the other side of the table. One of the six gates leads to a balcony overlooking what you assume is an entry hall, with stairs down on either side. Down there sit a few more people, and there's great big doors on either side, leading to other chambers, and one even larger at the end, the main gate.

The opposite side of the table has its gate lead to a staircase up, and up to a set of double doors, sensibly shut. You take a guess that there beyond is the inner chamber, and the Two Fingers, whatever they may be. You call that north, so the entry hall is south.

Next you explore the west wing through the northwest gate, finding two levels of bedchambers, drawing rooms, lumber rooms, textile rooms, and... a room dedicated to a pile of corpses, slowly mummifying.

Through the southwest gate you find a banquet hall and a kitchen downstairs with an expansive pantry, root cellar, and wine cellar, all empty, and even a well. Going further you find an abattoir and utility room adjacent to the kitchen, and these connecting to an entry hall with an adjoining _stable._ Unused, of course --- the hay has turned to dust.

You're quite sure there's no way that these rooms could exist thusly without opening to one another.

The northeast wing leads to a grand library the likes of which you have never seen, two storeys of it. You spy ser Ofnir perusing the volumes. There's a few others, too, but Gideon seems to be the head librarian.

Last, you head into the southeast, and hear the sound of labor. A hammer striking steel. Perhaps here is a smith of great skill like Blaidd spoke of. There's steps of stone down to the work floor, and great furnaces and machines sit there; at the far end of the room a gate to the outside --- if there even is such a thing. Off to one side is a vast armory of all manner of weaponry imaginable.

There is but one man at work.

A chimera. The feather-fur on his arms is singed, and his callouses have callouses. There's horns and other growths --- barnacle-like --- on his head, and he mumbles to himself as he works. Heating steel to smith it.

And you see the the collar of black steel, and the chain hung from the ceiling.

A slave.

He stops for a moment and rests both elbows on his anvil. "_Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness. The work is yet long; a God is not easily felled. With time, without fail, you will have your wish. So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika._"

Then he resumes muttering, picking up the tongs and pulling hot steel from the fire, selecting a suitable hammer, and begins the work.

You step out of the shadows and approach.

"Hullo, a new arrival?"

"Who are you?" you ask.

"Master weapon smith of the Roundtable. Name is Hewg. No matter, it's all the same. Lay out your arms, or chose from the stock."

"You're chained to the ceiling --- are you a slave?"

"Nothing special. I'm trapped in this forge by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. That's all there is to it." He looks at you with a piercing, wise stare. "Don't read too much into it. I've no grudge against any of you --- my being a prisoner is no fault of yours. Besides, I don't mind the work of a smith, and the work helps me forget... _her._"

You feel a terrible rage rise within you. "How long have you been here?"

"I don't know. It's no matter. Either give me work, or give me peace, girl."

"Master Hewg---"

"Nay. I've seen your sort many times, Tarnished. Soft-hearted ones that insist I should be freed. They rarely last long --- some fall into despair and sit around until the end of days. Some seek solace in Fia's arms o'er in her bedchambers. Some leave to wander and never return. I remain a prisoner."

You come up to him. "I'm sure you have, Master Hewg. Can you keep a secret?"

"I care not enough to share any I hear."

You lean on his anvil with both hands.

"My name is Ezekiel. My Shadow is called Titania --- she's a Chimera like you. I am chosen not by Grace but by the Two Fingers, an Empyrean like that Queen Marika to whom you pray for forgiveness..."

You think for a moment, finding the words.

"When I say I will see you freed from bondage, take it with the same surety as when the Queen imprisoned you here and set you to forge a weapon that could kill her."

He looks at you for a long while. Then he pulls steel from the furnace. "Move."

You take your hands off his anvil, and he goes to work.

"Don't speak like that to me again. Lay out your arms, chose something from the armory, or leave."

You oblige his request and unsling your sword from your back. With a whistle, Torrent obligingly appears --- even here --- and you retrieve the somber stone from his saddlebag. "This is my father's sword, and a stone I was given --- I was told a skilled smith would know what to do with them."

Hewg puts the iron he is working aside, he accepts the stone, inspecting it. "Touched by dragonfire. Rare specimen." He puts it down and draws your sword --- his arm span so long it is more like drawing a shortsword to him. "Fine blade. Well maintained. Good balance. Needs re-hardening of the edge and re-hilting. You will have your blade ready and imbued by the strike of the next bell."

"How many of those in a day and night?"

"Twelve."

You take out a little bauble of runes to pay him.

"No matter. I take no payment."

You leave him to his work and it with him, despite his wishes and without a word.

It was a guess, but apparently a true one. Queen Marika herself imprisoned this man here to labor forever at creating a weapon that can kill a god: herself. Another mystery.

----

Heading back up to the round table, you find Titania still conversing with the man in the strange armor --- same as the other times you came by her. You come up to her.

"Jester, this is Dee; Dee, this is my friend, Jester."

"Charmed," you say. "Nameless, a word?"

You pull her aside, over by the fireplace.

"_Listen, down in the armory, they have a chimera chained up._" You immediately put a hand on her arm. "_Calm down._"

"_I am calm. Angry, but calm._"

"_I think it was_ Queen Marika _who chained him up there. And he's in a forge --- something is preventing him from simply cutting the chain with his tools._"

"_We're still going to break him out, right?_"

"_Absolutely._"

Titania pats you on the back. "_While we figure that out, Dee is trying to recruit us to help clean out a 'living dead' problem in Limgrave. He serves an order led by a beast named Gurranq, and they're hurting for manpower._"

"_What's in it for us?_"

"_Allies, resources, introduction to this Gurranq who grants gifts to his followers. I'm interested, at the very least._"

"_Good. I spoke to the holyman, Corhyn, he claims to be able to teach miracle working._"

"_You're interested._"

"_Yes._"

"_Then let's split up. Dee is going scouting, I'll join him, earn an introduction._"

You blink at that suggestion.

"_Can you make your way back here?_"

"_I'm thinking: if I'm your Shadow, why shouldn't I be able to do all the Grace things in your stead also?_"

"_Let's find that out._"

-----

It takes Titania rather shorter a time to figure out than it did you. Helping no doubt was it that she could watch you do it. She takes the two of you from the church where you met Kalé to the Roundtable Hold, sealing the soundness of th plan. Squall comes when called by her as well. You make a mental note to procure more raisins.

"Now you take care of yourself," you say quietly to her. "Don't do anything stupid, and if you get hurt---" you press the little golden flask into her hand.

"Really?" she asks.

"You're going off to fight the living dead. I'm just going on a hike. Besides, Melina says she can brew another if I find the ingredients."

She takes it and spirits it away in her pocket. Then she puts her gentle hands on your shoulders and puts her forehead to yours. "You take care too, right?"

"I promise."

Then she goes with Dee through the enormous shard of Grace above the table. You head to Corhyn, who seems to have fallen asleep. It's a wonder you have yet to stumble over any of the wretches sitting on the floor --- some of them look positively emaciated.

"Brother Corhyn?"

He looks up at you. "Ah, Jester. Did you sate your curiosity about the Hold?"

"Mostly. I've left my sword to be worked on by Master Hewg, he will have it ready in a short while."

"I am in no hurry. That misbegotten, are they your lover?"

"She strongly prefers 'chimera' and no. She is my loyal knight. My heart beats for another."

"My pardons. I've never heard them referred to as 'chimera' before."

"Down south in the city of Morning, they do so. Nameless is the Lord, there, and the court is all chimeric. There was a slave rebellion, which overthrew the human Lord."

"I see. It may be heresy but I think it is an injustice that chimera do not have a place in the Erdtree's light. Your friend seems very virtuous."

"I shall convey the compliment to her."

-----

While you wait, you explore the library for a while, perusing the notes written on scraps of parchment nailed to each shelf. _Histories of the second intermittent age,_ one reads.

There is an utter fortune in books here.

Apart from Gideon sitting at the central table, reading, a man in full armor is standing guard --- for what reason you can't imagine --- and his visor is in the image a skull.

A dark-skinned woman with pearls braided into her long dark hair is sorting books. She wears a finely embroidered doublet and a wolf pelt around her waist. Captivatingly fair.

You head down the stairs to the lower level and approach her. "Greetings," you say quietly.

"And to you," she replies. "Might I help you?"

"Perhaps. I'm Jester."

"Nepheli Loux."

"I will be heading out with Brother Corhyn to study miracles. Do you have something about miracles?"

"Yes, but per Gideon's rules, it cannot leave this library. Come with." She heads off towards a section of shelves, you follow..

"Certainly. Are you his assistant?"

"Daughter."

"I see. And that one?" you discretely point at the man in the strange armor.

"Ensha. He is a servant of my father."

She goes over the volumes, and picks out a narrow book among a few copies. "This is a short prayerbook of the two fingers, introduction written by Petrus the Pious."

You accept it and make a note of the shelf it came from. "And where might I read?"

She points you to a desk.

"Thank you ever so much, fair Nepheli. I shall hopefully return in not so long and repay the favor."

She looks you up and down. "Sure, whatever."

You sit down to read --- you are out of practice and have not yet learned to read without mouthing the words like your father says scholars can. The manual you purchased from Kalé is very terse, this is very verbose.

> <strong>I</strong>_n the theurgy of the Two Fingers, servants of the Greater Will, faith is of utmost importance. The Golden Order, created as the will of our kindly ruler Queen Marika the Eternal, must be foremost in thy mind and love. From thine devotion shall flow the power from the Greater Will through the Two Fingers through Queen Marika through the Golden Order through to your hands. Thereto thine might shall be protection of the righteous and virtuous and rebuke of the evil, honoring the Golden Order and thereby Queen Marika and thereby the Two Fingers and thereby the Greater Will---_

There's the striking of a bell, somewhere in a distant part of the Hold.

You close the book, and head up to put it back where Nepheli took it. Then you climb the stairs and head to the forge.

There your sword stands ready for you to claim.

"'Tis done, as promised," Hewg says. "Blade tempered in dragonflame. You will find it cuts finer, now, and the blade will burn thy foes."

You draw your father's sword and give it a twirl. The new hilt feels firmer in your hand. "Thank you so much Master Hewg."

"You're welcome milady."

With it in hand, you head back up to the Grace, and spot another face there. A woman dressed in black robes, walking among the resting Tarnished. She picks out one, and offers them a hand to get up on shaking legs, then leads them off to the residential wing.

"Who was that?" you ask Corhyn.

"Fia, the Deathbed Companion. She lies with warriors and champions as their last wishes."

"And then what?"

"They never return from her bedchambers."

"So the corpse pile in that one room---"

"Yes."

"Barbaric."

"Is it? These poor souls have lost all will to live. I've scarcely seen them move. So what if she provides them one last bout of pleasure. Whatever you do, accept not her invitation to bed --- not a problem for myself, as prefer the company of men, but I imagine you might feel tempted."

"Oh. Yeah, absolutely not. If anyone, I'd rather bed Nepheli Loux."

"I do believe she is firmly and only a lover of men. Did you get your sword?"

"I did."

----

Corhyn takes the two of you to a sunny hilltop.

"Where are we?"

"Limgrave. My travels have not taken me far, yet. I have been spending much time in the Hold, in ser Ofnir's library. My goal is the capital, Leyndell. It lies on the Altus plateau, north of the land Liurnia, yet north of here. We have a ways to go, but travel only with me until you feel you have learned what you need."

"I see. Do you have a steed?"

"Alas, no. But my faith carries me lightfooted. I usually do not stop to rest save at night, and I've been told I walk quite quickly."

You whistle for Torrent.

"Oh, what wonder."

He sets off down the hill, and you follow on Torrent.

"So, what now?"

"I prefer to walk in silence for a while to gather my thoughts, before I can give any lessons."

You oblige and ride on in quietude. The sun passes the zenith, and you reach a gravel path to follow. Corhyn does indeed set a pace you would consider a forced march.

"Do you have strange dreams?"

"Sometimes."

"What of?"

"The night before I met Nameless, I dreamt of the Two Fingers."

"Very good, very good. What is your faith in them?"

"They exist."

"I see. Any other dreams?"

"I often dream of fire."

"Aha. We may encounter the Fire Monks in Liurnia. Some consider them anathema, but they practice the taming of the dangerous Giant's Flame into the useful Small Flame. Fire is a diligent servant but a cruel master, better keep our knowledge of it at hand."

"Do you know any Small Flame miracles, Brother Corhyn?"

"Just a handful. I can light and extinguish a candle or a campfire, and I've in a pinch used a blast of fire against a ruffian."

"I expect some run-ins with ruffians, myself. I should like to learn how to do that."

Dee is anything but a light-hearted man.

Titania fights in water to her knees, a ghostly foe in a flooded village. Its people shamble about. Dee's waves of holy light turn the horde. 

The bloodhound's fang rips through dead flesh. Bestial strength pulls the necromancer from its phantom vessel. Pommel crushes skull.

Victory.

Dee winnows the root of death with but a saw. Best would be to burn it, but the water makes it impossible.

They set off east, to a red land, free of death's influence but for worse things. Through a strange gate that spans hundreds of leagues.

She gazes at the stars and thinks of you, every night.

----

Six days pass in the road with Corhyn, and he has near endless stories to tell. Parables and morality tales, myths and legends. You slow both of you down, taking every occasion to recognize plants and growths from your field manual.

Once, long ago, there was a great crucible under the land, from where all life came. The Erdtree grew from it, but its influence is still felt to this day, in the form of chimera and the birthing of omen children. Who created the world, then?

The demigod Godwyn, son of Marika, slew the dragon king Gransax, but befriended the dragon prince Fortisax and forged the pact between the Golden Order and the draconic lineages, creating the dragon cults whose theurgy could summon the wrath of the heavens. Why are there wars?

The mountain ranges far to the north was home to the giants, who worshipped a fell god of fire. They had a flame hot enough to burn the Erdtree, and were slaughtered to a man by Queen Marika's armies. Is that justice?

Marika's first husband, Godfrey, was the war-band leader Hoarah Loux, and Queen Marika banished him and all his warriors, tarnishing them from Grace and sending them out to sea and into the mists in exile. What of warriors in peacetime?

You get much of the sense that Corhyn likes hearing himself talk. He has no answers to his big questions.

But there's something soothing about it, too. Unpretentious. If you're a Jester, he's most certainly a Preacher.

He tells of his past followers. Tarnished and still-blessed, who traveled with him, sometimes for years. "I've no great wisdom to impart. But perhaps it is the little wisdoms that we live by."

He has you ride along with a dry stick, one end smoldering, for days on end. "You must carry the fire to show your devotion. Do not let it extinguish. Through that effort, learn to carry it in your heart, too."

You're pretty sure you're already carrying fire in your heart. 

On the seventh day, you gather dry firewood, kiss your rosary, and wish for fire. The wood alights in an instant. You feel weak and cold for a long moment afterwards.

"That's it. Very good," Corhyn says.

"I was afraid you'd say I've got the spark," you reply. He chuckles sensibly.

You hunt a goat with your crossbow, fry the prime cuts in its own fat, and season the meat with a spicy sauce made from wild herbs.

"Brother Corhyn," you say.

"Yes, Jester?"

"I've a confession to make, if you will hear."

"Speak your mind."

"I've not been forthcoming to you. Now that I've had time to judge your character, I feel you should know the truth."

He looks at you, through the gauze. Just as you cover your face, he covers his eyes.

"I am no mere Tarnished. I have been chosen by the Two Fingers, as an Empyrean. Nameless is not my knight, she is my Shadow."

"I see."

"Please keep that a secret."

"Confessions are always confidential, Jester."

"My real name is Ezekiel, Nameless' is Titania. I named her when first we met. Do you know of Melina?"

"I do. I've met her once or twice, but I have not upheld my part of our bargain --- as many others."

"She confirmed it. I've every intent to travel to the Erdtree and become Elden Lord."

"You have the flame of ambition. Perhaps that is why you so quickly mastered a fire miracle."

----

<div align=right>
```

Up a hill full of horrors. Guarded by shadows of men. A great being of stone animated by black wax. A sanctuary.

Inside, a beast.

Titania, unafraid, shares with him the deathroot and asks for induction into the order.

Gurranq accepts her as apprentice.

-----

You pass by the vast city of Stormburg at a distance of leagues. It is visible on a clear day, up the mountain pass to Liurnia. At the south of the city lies Stormveil, an absurd fortification. Great bridges reach off across the gorges in the landscape, and a tower taller than you thought possible.

Getting to King Godrick will not be easy.

In the mountain pass you find a hallow of Grace nestled in a shack about to collapse on itself.

"Hello? Is someone there?"

You recognize the voice, and a chill runs down your spine. You turn to Corhyn and whisper "_stay back,_" and draw your sword. Heading inside you find _Irina_, her dress and headwraps dirtied, a visible scar on her neck, and a dark shawl over her shoulders.

"Good... day?" you say. "Who are you?"

"My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light."

"Call me Jester. Does the name Irina mean anything to you?"

"No. Should it?"

"I suppose not. One moment." You head back out of the shack, over to Corhyn.

"_What's going on?_" he whispers.

"_There's a woman in there... or rather, something inhabiting the corpse of a woman. I saw her killed with mine own eyes down south on the Weeping Insula --- Irina was her name. Now she's standing in there, head reattached, calling herself Hyetta._"

"_A miracle?_"

"_An ill omen, more like._"

"_Is she violent?_"

"_No. She's blind._"

"_Then I suppose there is no harm in talking to her, no? Put the sword away. We're capable and of arms._"

You sheathe your sword and head back into the shack. "Pardon me, fair lady. I am traveling with a fellow more cautious than I. What is this 'distant light' you follow?" You keep a hand on the pommel of your dagger.

"I know not, but... If I might be so bold, do you happen to have any Shabriri Grapes?"

"I don't know what those are?"

"My eyesight has been weak since birth so I can't rightly tell you what they look like. But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light in the back of my eyes. I believe I must follow it."

"To what end?"

"It will lead me to my true duty: becoming a Finger Maiden."

You nod slowly. "Well, fair maiden Hyetta, I wish the all the best. Should I come by 'Shabriri Grapes' in my travels, I'll be sure to pluck some for you."

"Thank you, kind Jester. Fare thee well."

You leave, thoroughly creeped out.

"Well?" Corhyn asks you once down the trail and out of earshot.

"Whatever that being was, I can't help but feel something is off."

"What did she want?"

"Something called Shabriri Grapes, to eat. And to become a Finger Maiden."

"Huh."

"What?"

"While the goal of becoming a Finger Maiden is honorable... Shabriri is the name of a man. The most reviled man in history, they call him. He gained the ear of the clergy and spread slander and libel leading to the wrongful persecution and slaughter of a whole people. He preached heresy disguised as orthodoxy, whipping his followers into a killing frenzy, and eventually to self-immolation. I cannot imagine why anyone would name a fruit after him."

Then you realize something. "Hang on. Wait." You reach into the saddle bag and retrieve the manual of the land, paging through to the section under 'esh' and from there not far before you find that suspicious word you could barely parse when you perused through this section. "You're more literate than I, Corhyn, is this those?" You show him the book, pointing.

"Why indeed. Esh-a-bra-i-ra-i. Shabriri."

"Oh."

"What?"

You look at the rough drawing.

You hand him the book

"Oh, sweet Queen Marika, forgive her."

You know what it says: _The pus-filled eyeballs of those consumed by the yellow madness._
