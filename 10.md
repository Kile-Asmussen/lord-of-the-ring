# A Land Full of Life

Yura is less than pleased, holding his hand on the hilt of his sword as you show him

"That is the bloodflame, alright."

The burning blood drips from your hand onto the grass, which doesn't catch fire --- if it had been a draught you wouldn't dare show it so brazenly.

"It makes a strange king of sense," you muse. "You know about Adan, the Thief of Fire?"

"No."

"I studied under the Fire Monks in Liurnia. They tell the story of a man named Adan who stole the Giant's Fire."

"I might have guessed," Yura mutters.

You chuckle. "Yeah, it's in the name, isn't it? The theft took place during Queen Marika's war, and afterwards, Adan founded what became the modern orders of the Fire Monks under Praetor Rykard --- keeping the Giant's Flame, the Flame of Ruin, tame and under the Golden Order's control."

"I fail to see the value of this history lesson," Yura says.

"Jester, Thief of Fire," Titania says. "Stole the Bloodflame from whatever it is that makes people become cessblood cultists."

"I'm still not convinced you aren't going to become one, yourself," Yura says, skeptically.

"Time will tell," you say. "Let's head south to Agheel lake and find a dragon."

----

It's another week's uneventful travel along the river, though at the outset you considered going back and stealing the ferry to use as a barge to travel downriver faster. It is much the same, save for Yura tagging along as your travel companion. He, too, knows to travel through Grace, even though he no longer sees its guidance.

He doesn't speak much in general, rarely initiating conversation, and he only seldom accept your food --- you don't mind either way if people want to partake in your cooking. Titania and especially Boc eat well.

Murkwater ends in lake Agheel, so vast the shore on the other side is barely visible; only the rocky island in its center. You hide away in the rocky terrain up river.

"Dragons are hungry creatures," Yura explains. "They do not _need_ to eat, but they hunger for flesh and fuel regardless."

"Fuel?" Boc asks.

"Yes. They eat plant matter, especially rotten wood if they can find it, to fuel their fiery breath."

"So we lay a trap," you say. "We hunt a deer or sheep, maybe two ---"

"Three, just to be safe," Titania adds.

"--- and find an old rotten log, pile it up on a stretch of beach and wait for a small dragon."

"Essentially," Yura says. "How do you plan to kill it?"

"Titania, how about I create an opening and you jump on its back and cut its wings?"

"Sounds reasonable."

"It might take off with you," Yura cautions.

"My spirit steed, Squall. He will come when I whistle, even in mid-air, and can land safely from any height. I myself can land safely from about ten fathoms up."

You turn to her. "In mid-air?"

"We practiced it when went to Gurranq after the siege of Haft."

"Right."

Yura clears his throat. "A dragon that can't fly, even a young dragon, is stil a _formidable_ creature. It will breathe fire on you."

"It'll be the dragon's fire against mine," you say. 

Yura puts a hand on your shoulder. "Jester, you're a clever and ambitious young woman. I must caution you strongly, I do not think you understand the gravity of fighting a dragon. Even if you fail it will pursue."

You put a hand on his. "Yura, I thank you for your advice. This is something we have to do, for Boc."

"I'll help, Cully," Boc says.

"No," Titania rumbles.

"Yes," Boc says. "There's nothing to hide under on the beach, so we'll need to dig holes, and cover those holes so the dragon doesn't see it from the air. For that you need a cloth covering to put dirt on top of, and you can't do that from inside the hole."

You look at Titania. "He has a point."

----

It takes a day to gather the bait and only after dark do you proceed to the beach to dig holes, by the dim light of the Erdtree. Dragons, fortunately, sleep at night.

Yura instructs you to split the bellies of the three sheep open, and for Titania to chop the rotten wood up to spread the smell. Then at dawn the next day, you place the bait, and you and Titania creep into each your hidey-hole and Boc uses the tentcloth for Titania, and a spare cloak for yours, nailing them down with the tent pegs, before laying a thin layer of beach gravel atop either. Him and Yura hide in the bushes in the rocks beyond the beach.

Out on the island, there are dragons circling and roosting --- that much is plainly visible, even at this distance. Yet it takes all the way to noon for your bait to be noticed.

You hear the enormous wing beats before you see the creature. It lands in the shallows and wanders onto the beach with heavy footfalls, using its bastard wings as front paws.

Through the little peephole you have a good view, and see the creature investigate the bait with little to no regard for caution. It is five times the length of Torrent. 

It picks up one of the sheep and gulps it down whole, and you take that as your moment to act. Its one flank is turned to you and the other to Titania; you need it with its back turned --- though then Titania will have to dodge the swiping tail.

Gathering power in the palm of your hand, you spring forth from your hole, sweaty and dirty, and run at the beast. It sees you but a moment too late and you hurl a heavy handful of burning blood in its face. Only some of it strike true, but you do get its attention.

It opens its maw, large enough to swallow you whole, just as it did the sheep, and screeches out a horrible bellow. You dance back on useless fencing instincts, and draw your sword.

Then Titania lands on its back and with a boulder in hand and throws the stone hard at one wing, then spins and with all her might lays a chop against the other wing, cutting flesh and ripping wing membrane.

The dragon screeches again, this time differently: in pain. It stumbles forward, no longer able to support weight on its wings, but manges to rise up on its hind legs. It shakes its back, trying to get her off, but Titania latches onto it with her clawed gauntlet and lays another powerful chop onto the beast's wing.

Then it lashes out in fear and pain against the only thing it can see: you.

It draws back, neck puffing up, and from its gullet comes a stream of fire, far larger than your own conjurations have ever been.

With all your willpower an determination, you push back, directing the flames around you. The heat singes your clothing, but it keeps you unharmed.

Almost.

The fire stops but before you can react, a claw the size of Torrent comes down on you. Leaping aside saves you from immediate death, but gets your leg caught and soundly crushed, breaking bone and possibly worse.

Titania swings around the beast's neck, attempting to do something, but with a flick of the dragon's long neck, she is sent flying.

Then it turns its attention on you, bending down and opening its maw full of dagger-sized teeth, intending to bite you to death.

But a projectile comes sailing through the air, shattering against its teeth. A splash of liquid coats the dragon's tongue and inside of its mouth, and it immediately draws back, gagging and retching.

You see your chance to strike and throw your sword out in a mighty curve, coming down in the side of the dragons face in a deep cut, slicing through the eye. Now the beast staggers back, freeing you, and gives another screech in pain.

Titania comes rushing in at a dead sprint, and with power that can sunder castle walls, cuts to the bone and likely through it, slicing sinew and tendon in the creature's leg and causing it to finally fall down.

She comes to you in an instant, picking you up like you weight nothing, and getting you out of its reach, fifty paces down the beach. But before she can put you down and run back to slaughter the dragon, Yura comes running dodging the dragon's thrashing and sinking his long slender blade into a soft spot under the chin.

The dragon jerks once, then falls, twitching twice more before coming to rest, dead.

"_Run! Agheel is coming!_"

Both of you look over the lake to the roost and two gigantic wings are raised into the sky.

Titania leaps into the air, whistling for Squall, and landing on his back.

You whistle for Torrent, and he appears in gallop beside you. "Let Yura ride you!" you call to him, and he veers off to Yura's side, who grabs hold of the saddle and leaps onto Torrent's back. Grabbing the reins he steers your steed aside to where Boc has not yet started running and with a strong arm, yanks Boc's slight hillfolk frame off the ground and onto the saddle in front of him.

Even at a dead gallop, on spectral steeds faster than any horse, traversing rocky terrain like it was flat ground, you hear the approaching wing beats behind you getting louder and louder. You twist in Titania's arms, ignoring the pain of your broken leg, and sees over her shoulder, _Agheel._

Her wingspan is at least twice, if not three times that of the dead dragon.

She puffs up her neck.

"Yura! Ride close!" you bellow.

And then the fire comes. Tenfold hotter and faster.

You call on everything, and commands the flame aside, parting it like a boulder in a flowing river---

-----

Coming to your senses injured is starting to be a distressingly regular thing, it seems. Everything stinks of smoke, and your clothes are sooty.

"Tania?" you call out and cough.

She's by your side immediately. "Hey, you're fine; we're fine."

Your leg aches, but not as bad as it did when broken.

"I gave you the draught while you were unconscious. Boc got a little singed, Yura has some burns, but we're all alive and well. You were _incredible,_ Zeke."

She pulls you into a hug, and you relish how safe you immediately feel. "We gotta stop doing this kind of thing."

Looking around you see Yura polishing his sword, and Boc having started a fire.

You're in a a cave --- or perhaps more of a deep niche --- in the side of a rock formation. It is raining, and at the back of the niche is a gate chiseled out in the stone, with a set of old wooden doors.

"You're really something else, Jester," Yura says. "Stopping Agheel's flame. Not even Eleanora could do something like that."

"Impressive or not, it was to no avail," you say.

"Say not so," Yura says. "Dragons do not practice cannibalism. Agheel will stay with the body for some time, grieving her young. By nightfall she will likely return to her roost, and we will have a window to do the necessary butchery."

Rising despite the ache in your leg, you hobble over to Boc, kneeling down beside him.

"Heya, Cully. You saved our skin."

You put an arm on his shoulder. "Thanks for the save."

"Hm?"

"You threw that pot into its mouth, right?"

"Oh... yeah, I did. Not that it did much."

"Don't be so modest, you saved me from getting bitten to death. What was in it?"

"I packed it with everything nasty and poisonous I could come up with --- I did it a few days ago, didn't want to make more than one, because we only have five of those jars."

You lean in and kiss him on the top of his head. "Thanks for saving my life, my loyal seamster."

"Aw, Cully, you're making me all embarrassed."

With your leg feeling better by the minute you grab your helmet, sword and shield, eyeing the strange door. "What's in there?"

"Probably an old catacomb," Yura says. "The dead linger there."

"Think I can find some of those ashes in there, for my bell?" you ask.

"Mayhaps."

"At the very least, I'll go make sure there isn't something lurking down there," you say. "Titania?"

"I'm tired," she rumbles. "Can it wait?"

You look to her, then the door.

Something draws you down there.

"Don't go rushing into danger," Titania says, noticing your pensiveness. "But if you must... I suppose there isn't going to be any dragons down there."

"Unlikely," Yura adds.

"Also if it is safe, we can retreat there if a dragon _does_ find us," you say.

"Let's go," Titania rumbles.

You head to the heavy wooden door and put both hands on it, pushing with all your might --- the door budges but slowly. Titania, impatient, puts her hands on it above yours and shoves it open in a single move, revealing a staircase down, to a midway landing.

On that landing is plainly the reason for the draw you felt: a hallow of Grace.

Descending, the air gets staler with every step, smelling of old bones, ash, and damp mold.

It is dead quiet, which is a good sign, but quite eerie. You reach the Grace and crouch down to touch it.

"Melina."

"Ezekiel." She appears out of a swirl of ashes. "Hi Titania, good to see you."

"Hi Melina."

She takes your hand and looks about."What manner of place is this?

"A catacomb, I think. Near Agheel lake. We slew a dragon, earlier today."

Melina looks at you with disbelief.

"A small one," you clarify. "We're going to butcher it once night falls."

"... For its heart?"

"For Boc, yes. We had help from a wandering swordsman named Yura."

She nods. "I vaguely remember such a man."

"So, a catacomb like this, what can we expect?"

"Nothing dangerous. There may be lingering spirits, their ashes yet to be drawn into the Erdtree's roots."

You take the silver bell from your pocket. "So, something to use with this one?"

She holds out a hand and you give it to her. "What fine craftsmanship. A Leyndell silversmith's work."

"If you say so. I was given it by a woman named Ranni."

Melina looks at you. "Ranni of Caria? The _Moon Witch?_ Princess of Liurnia?"

You shrug.

"Zeke, I love you but you simply must tell me such things earlier. Let us first explore, then we shall discuss Princess Ranni." She takes you by the arm.

Holding out your hand, you conjure a flame to see by.

Proceed down the stairs together, Titania trailing behind, you find branching paths with cubbies for urns and skulls and niches for sarcophagi.

Melina stops at an intersection and looks about. "The main root is this way."

The hallway opens up into a vast hall, ceiling supported by columns. The distant wall is a knot of gnarled growths, and before it stands a ghostly figure.

A translucent knight in full armor, with decorative wings on his back, sword at his hip, and shield on his back, seated atop a horse.

Both the rider and horse are headless. He draws his sword.

"Ah. A mausoleum guard," Melina says.

"Do I kill him?" you ask.

"She certainly intends us harm for intruding."

With a gesture, your father's sword flies from its sheath and you thrust your hand forwards, sending the blade directly through the ghostly figure's torso, knocking her off her horse. There's a sound like ripping paper, as the knight dissolves into ash, and a small bounty of runes come to rest with you.

"But yes, that knight is actually an example of these very ashes we are here to find. Though, the spiritcallers of auld would carry bandoleers full of bells, each with a spirit bound. You only have the one, which means you can only bind a single spirit."

You look at the ashen stain where the knight fell. Perhaps having a spirit bodyguard would be useful?

"So this is the roots of the Erdtree?" Titania asks, pointing to the back wall.

"Yes."

"Just how far do those roots reach? All the way from the capital? That's hundreds of miles."

"Throughout all the Lands Between. The Erdtree is divine; distance is no object."

"Incredible," Titania mutters. "Say, Zeke?"

You look at her.

She points at the horse, which has wandered over to the wall. "Boc needs his own horse."

"Allow me?" Melina asks, holding up the bell and removing the leather strap holding the clapper in place.

"Go right ahead."

She walks up to the headless beast of burden, and puts a hand on its neck, ringing the bell. The horse dissolves into ashes, but instead of falling to the ground, swirls itself into the bell.

Then she re-secures the clapper with the leather strap, and hands it back to you.

Melina grabs you by the collar and pulls you down for a deep kiss. "Let's get to the surface and discuss Ranni, before my time here runs out."

-----

Emerging topside, Yura and Boc sit where you left them.

"That was quick, Cully. Hello Lady Melina." He takes off his hat.

"Hello again, Boc."

Yura stands and takes of his strange helmet. "Lady Melina, it has been many years."

"Indeed it has, Yura. How fare you?"

"I yet draw breath."

You take a seat by the fire, and Melina sits next to you, taking your hand.

"So," you say. "Ranni."

"Princess Ranni, daughter of Queen Rennala and Elden Lord Radagon. A demigod. How did you meet her?"

"She found me at a small church, a few days after Nameless became the Lord of Morning. I helped her servant, Blaidd, in an unrelated manner, early in my quest. He told her of my riding Torrent, and she claimed the previous rider of Torrent held this bell."

Melina nods. "Princess Ranni was chosen as Empyrean. Blaidd is her Shadow."

"Oh. Well, then she and I have something in common. Should we visit Liurnia after Stormburg?" you ask.

"No. As far as I know, Ranni committed a cardinal sin to divest herself of the hold the Two Fingers had over her. Her divine body is dead, and she inhabits a dollmaker's artifice made in her teacher's likeness."

"So she might not like that I am Empyrean too?"

"Hang on, _Empyrean?_" Yura sputters.

You look at him. "Chosen by the Two fingers. Nameless is my Shadow."

You give Melina's hand and look back at her. "So, steer clear of Ranni?"

"If at all possible."

"Good to know. Wanna stick around for a social occasion? I'll cook us some dinner?"

She shakes her head and leans into meet you in a kiss, before vanishing into ash.

"Good riddance, to think I've been traveling with one of the divinely invested," Yura mutters.

"Doesn't change much about how things have gone, does it? I'm literally just another Tarnished."

"I suppose."

"And, what, Melina is in love with you?"

"We are in love, yes. It is difficult, as she is... in the state that she is."

Yura says nothing.

"Ezekiel," you say.

He looks at you.

"That is my real name. You're a trustworthy man, Yura. You deserve to know."

"I see."

"And I'm Titania."

"Ezekiel, Titania," Yura repeats. "Many strange revelations today."

-----

Agheel spends the entirety of the day grieving her dead offspring. Boc is up to the task of spying on the enormous beast, and tells of how the mother keeps licking the wounds of its young and trying to get it to rise with gentle nudges, and growling at it.

It almost makes you feel bad, leaving a mother with the mangled corpse of her young.

The sun goes down, and you head back ot the beach to do the necessary butchery, and leave behind a bloody corpse for the scavengers. The heart of the beast is the size of your entire torso. You are done and stained in blood and viscera by midnight, and yet you cook up the first serving of it for Boc.

The organ has strange hard scales on one side, that your knives simply can't cut in any way.

But you also set out before dawn comes, away from the lake shores, away from the watchful eyes of Agheel and her brood.

You say your goodbyes to Yura and wish him well, as he sets off to the north towards Liurnia where other cessblood cultists might roam. You, Titania, and Boc set your course west towards Fringefolk.

The first moon, of three, comes and goes in the road; or as much of the time you actually spend on roads. A lot of the time you merely let yourself be guided by Grace, from one hallow to the next, going roughly in a western direction. Boc rides on his ash spirit steed, while you and Titania ride Torrent and Squall. It is not quite as nimble, but makes up for it in perseverance: it is a dead thing, it knows not what tiredness is.

On one particularly clear day, cresting a hill, you see the canyon that leads from the Lake Lowlands to the Stormhill Highlands to the north, where lies Stormburg and Stormveil. It is defended by a fortification large enough to appear insurmountable even at this far a distance. You begin to wonder how the forces of Haight plan to deal with that.

You come one eve to the ruins of another church, though in better condition than you've seen. The roof is half caved in a defaced statue of Queen marika stands, arms and half the face broken off. The tiled floors are shattered and weeds grow where the sun shines.

And there sits a familiar face. Kalé, the merchant.

"Kalé!" you call out.

"Why, if it isn't Jester, my loyal customer?"

You head over by his little fire, commanding the flame to turn smokeless and clear the air, while sparing the fuel.

"Oh indeed. I'd like to peruse your wares, and perhaps repay you the hospitality you showed me moons ago by cooking you a delicious meal?"

"I shan't say no to either." He looks at Titania and Boc in turn. "I see you've some interesting travel companions? And a mightily impressive new suit of armor."

You wave Titania over to sit. "This here is--- well, I suppose you'd rather know her as Nameless than by her real name?"

"Ah, a strong lady knight," Kalé says. "You take good care of Jester, now, Nameless. She's too kind for her own good."

Titania smiles. "I make every effort."

"And the small gentleman over there is Boc the Seamster."

Boc, inspecting the statue, turns and tips his hat to Kalé who does the same in turn.

You whistle for Torrent to come over and take out the cooking stand and your cookware from his saddlebags, the small log you use as a work table, your good knife and cutting board, and the canvas bags of food you've foraged on your journeys. There nothing left of the dragon heart, fortunately --- it had a pungent smell when fried.

"I've come across something you might be interested in, actually," Kalé says and goes to rummage through his horse's saddle bags, too. He lays out a blanket and starts arranging trinkets and wares on it.

"Boc?" you call out. "Come here and see what's for sale. Then tell me how you want your meat spiced."

"One moment, Cully," Boc calls back.

You look over to see him climb the statue, and with a small jar in hand he collects something from the statue's intact eye. He leaps down --- four times his own height --- landing gracefully.

He comes over to show you the content of his small jar. "Look. It was like the statue over there was crying."

"Ah, a miracle of sorts," Kalé says. "I heard once that statues of Queen Marika shed tears for her lost golden child."

"Godwyn?" Titania asks.

"Miquella."

You take the jar from Boc's hand and look at the pearlescent liquid inside, feeling the _power_ in it.

It feels a lot like the little flask you keep in a leather cord around your neck.

"Now see here," Kalé says. "This is a golden seed off the Minor Erdtree in Mistwood."

"I'll take it!" you say immediately, and take out the entire weight of runes you hold, handing it to Kalé.

"Why this is far too much---"

"Give the change to Nameless," you say, snatching the golden seed and getting on Torrent, riding out of the church. "I'll be right back!"

You ride out into the night, tuning your eyes to the light of grace and letting it lead you to a hallow of Grace in a nook under large tree. "Melina!" you shout.

"Zeke?!" she appears from thin air.

You hold up the seed and jar. "I need another flask, also, dinner?"

"Of course, and yes please."

You get off Torrent to put a foot in the light of Grace --- that must be as good as touching it with your hand --- and help your lady love up to sit sidesaddle on your loyal steed, before getting into the saddle behind her and taking the reins.

She turns to kiss you, and you spur Torrent on, back to the church.

------

Melina spends time carving out the innards of the golden seed and inserting neck and stopper, mixing the sacred tear with a drop of her blood. She emanates holy power the whole time.

"What a woman you've got yourself, there," Kalé says.

Titania and Boc have spent a good deal of your runes, Boc on a collection of strange jars bearing odd ornamentation in the clay. As the mutton sizzles in your skillet, you see him pick one up and throw it hard at the church wall. It startles you some.

But then the shards and dust fly from where they landed, back to Boc's hand, assembling themselves into a hale vessel.

"Neat," Titania rumbles. She's cleaning her armor --- moons of adventuring has scuffed and weathered it, but the gift from her mentor will hold strong for many moons yet.

"Kalé, friend, where in all the Lands Between did you get these?" Boc says. He throws another one at the wall, much to the same effect.

"Came across a camp of Living Jars just two days ago. If you want to learn how to make them yourself you might yet catch them if you ride out tomorrow."

-----

Melina stays with you until late and you sequester yourselves away in a corner of the church to cuddle and enjoy each other's intimate company, while Titania and Boc make friends with Kalé over wine.

"You're very warm," Melina mutters to you, lying against your chest, listening to your heartbeat through the linen of your shirt.

"I hope I won't one day be too hot for you to touch."

"I was thrown to the fire, once. Yours is a much kinder flame."

-----

In the morning you set out to find the living jars, following Kalé's advice and direction. Riding hard you reach the banks of a small lake, where indeed, strange beings labor in the clay-rich banks. They have built kilns out of stacked mud and clay, and tend to fires within them.

They are indeed... jars. Some the size of large cooking vessels, some large enough to contain several entire sheep. All of them with wooden or stoneware lids, some bound with twine, others sealed in wax; some adorned in great varieties of patterns in the clay of their bodies, others with faces sculpted in them.

Their limbs seem made from compacted ash, soil, clay, resin, and bone shards, and they have a great variety of them. Some have short legs, some have long, some have more than two. Some have two arms, some have more, some have appendages with hooks rather than hands.

A particularly large one, unadorned save for a single band of curlicues halfway up its jar, sealed with a plate of red waxed wood, with long arms and legs that look strong, reacts to your presence. It picks up an _iron boat anchor_ and comes up to you on long strides.

"State your business!" it calls out in a deep man's voice.

"We mean no harm!" you call out. "I am Jester the traveler, this is my knight, Nameless, and my seamster Boc. We heard of you from Kalé the merchant, we're interested in the little jars you sold him, the ones that become hale after shattering?"

The jar warrior stops. "What does a traveling Tarnished have a knight and a seamster for?"

"Jester seeks to be the Elden Lord," Titania says. "She has promised safety and justice for all downtrodden peoples. That includes you living jars --- evil men hunt you for sport, do they not? Jester will put an end to this."

"Very well," the jar says. "I am Iron Fist Alexander. These are the men in my charge. We've already been accosted by potchers once on our journey --- hence the kiln. Two of our number need repairs."

Boc hops off his horse, which vanishes into his bell. "Why, ser Alexander, I'm a student of all things strange in this world. Might I learn how one makes these marvelous jars that repair themselves?"

Alexander regards him. "If you can prove yourself useful, we shall teach you the secret. But are you not a seamster rather than a potter?"

"I work with my hands, ser Alexander. The delicate work with clay requires a steady hand, as does needlework."

"I reckon. We jars do not have much need of fabrics."

"With respect, ser Alexander," you say. "I am an adept in the arts of flame, I can help with the kilns?"

"I shan't say no."

"I'll chop some wood, ifn you need," Titania rumbles.

"Why... that is an unprecedented helpfulness." Alexander turns and waves you along back to the kilns.

----

By eventide, Boc has learned the secrets of jar-making, you have learned how earthenware and stoneware are kissed by fire, and Titania has learned how strong a Warrior Jar can truly be, having had a friendly spar with Alexander.

The jars leave behind their kilns, and you send them off with flower wreaths made from erdleaf blooms.

That evening after making camp, Boc starts cooking up tallow with smoldering butterfly wings, and ash of linwood and burnt chalk made in the kilns. He fills the repulsive concoction in his new jars, seals them with wax, and tests one in his sling.

It explodes with tremendous force against a rock poking out of the water of the shallow, muddy lake.

"I reckon that will be useful, soon."

Boc stands there, in the faint light of the Erdtree, admiring his handiwork leaving smoke and cinders drifting about out over the water, while the jar reassembles in his hand.

He stands taller and stronger than when you met him. No longer is he a meek seamster. Perhaps you have gained another loyal warrior.
