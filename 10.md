Yura is less than pleased, holding his hand on the hilt of his sword as you show him

"That is the bloodflame, alright."

The burning blood drips from your hand onto the grass, which doesn't catch fire --- if it had been a draught you wouldn't dare show it so brazenly.

"It makes a strange king of sense," you muse. "You know about Adan, the Thief of Fire?"

"No."

"I studied under the Fire Monks in Liurnia. They tell the story of a man named Adan who stole the Giant's Fire."

"I might have guessed," Yura mutters.

You chuckle. "Yeah, it's in the name, isn't it? The theft took place during Queen Marika's war, and afterwards, Adan founded what became the modern orders of the Fire Monks under Praetor Rykard --- keeping the Giant's Flame, the Flame of Ruin, tame and under the Golden Order's control."

"I fail to see the value of this history lesson," Yura says.

"Jester, Thief of Fire," Titania says. "Stole the Bloodflame from whatever it is that makes people become cessblood cultists."

"I'm still not convinced you aren't going to become one, yourself," Yura says, skeptically.

"Time will tell," you say. "Let's head south to Agheel lake and find a dragon."

----

It's another week's uneventful travel along the river, though at the outset you considered going back and stealing the ferry to use as a barge to travel downriver faster. It is much the same, save for Yura tagging along as your travel companion. He, too, knows to travel through Grace, even though he no longer sees its guidance.

He doesn't speak much in general, rarely initiating conversation, and he only seldom accept your food --- you don't mind either way if people want to partake in your cooking. Titania and especially Boc eat well.

Murkwater ends in lake Agheel, so vast the shore on the other side is barely visible; only the rocky island in its center. You hide away in the rocky terrain up river.

"Dragons are hungry creatures," Yura explains. "They do not _need_ to eat, but they hunger for flesh and fuel regardless."

"Fuel?" Boc asks.

"Yes. They eat plant matter, especially rotten wood if they can find it, to fuel their fiery breath."

"So we lay a trap," you say. "We hunt a deer or sheep, maybe two ---"

"Three, just to be safe," Titania adds.

"--- and find an old rotten log, pile it up on a stretch of beach and wait for a small dragon."

"Essentially," Yura says. "How do you plan to kill it?"

"Titania, how about I create an opening and you jump on its back and cut its wings?"

"Sounds reasonable."

"It might take off with you," Yura cautions.

"My spirit steed, Squall. He will come when I whistle, even in mid-air, and can land safely from any height. I myself can land safely from about ten fathoms up."

You turn to her. "In mid-air?"

"We practiced it when went to Gurranq after the siege of Haft."

"Right."

Yura clears his throat. "A dragon that can't fly, even a young dragon, is stil a _formidable_ creature. It will breathe fire on you."

"It'll be the dragon's fire against mine," you say. 

Yura puts a hand on your shoulder. "Jester, you're a clever and ambitious young woman. I must caution you strongly, I do not think you understand the gravity of fighting a dragon. Even if you fail it will pursue."

You put a hand on his. "Yura, I thank you for your advice. This is something we have to do, for Boc."

"I'll help, Cully," Boc says.

"No," Titania rumbles.

"Yes," Boc says. "There's nothing to hide under on the beach, so we'll need to dig holes, and cover those holes so the dragon doesn't see it from the air. For that you need a cloth covering to put dirt on top of, and you can't do that from inside the hole."

You look at Titania. "He has a point."

----

It takes a day to gather the bait and only after dark do you proceed to the beach to dig holes, by the dim light of the Erdtree. Dragons, fortunately, sleep at night.

Yura instructs you to split the bellies of the three sheep open, and for Titania to chop the rotten wood up to spread the smell. Then at dawn the next day, you place the bait, and you and Titania creep into each your hidey-hole and Boc uses the tentcloth for Titania, and a spare cloak for yours, nailing them down with the tent pegs, before laying a thin layer of beach gravel atop either. Him and Yura hide in the bushes in the rocks beyond the beach.
