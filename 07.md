# Rightful Ruler of Limgrave

Nepheli leads you through grace to somewhere seemingly in Limgrave.

"Where are we, then?"

"Southern Limgrave. I've a contact to meet up with --- toppling King Godrick will necessitate enabling a new dynasty in his place. The house of Haight has long been critical of the crown of Limgrave, and rule over the second-largest city in the land, Haft."

You whistle for Torrent, and Titania for Squall.

"Got a horse?" Titania asks Nepheli.

"Never needed one." She sets into a light-footed jog, despite her amor, pack, and shield and ax strapped to her back. Like a deer darting through the forest.

"Down, woman," Titania mutters to you. "Already got a girl of your own, remember?"

"Doesn't mean I must blind my eyes to beauty when I see it, just that I keep my hands to myself," you retort, and spur Torrent into a trot.

You ride through the morning and over noon, taking shortcuts by descending steep escarpments rather than following the roads --- Nepheli can take jumps that should kill mortal men and land in gusts of wind much like Torrent and Squall. It is captivating to behold.

"I could probably do that too, you know," Titania says.

"You don't need to be jealous, love," you reply. "Maybe you should ask her to teach you a thing or two about mastering the wind."

By twilight you draw close to the city, and on a hill overlooking the slopes towards the sea, you see a circle of bonfires around the outer walls.

"A siege? No. Fuck!" Nepheli says.

"What's the matter?" Titania asks.

"Godrick has sent his armies to eliminate the competition," you venture. "But is it that much of a problem? Nepheli are you strong?"

She looks at you. "I can hold my own in a fight against ten men."

"Good. Do you have one of these?" You hold out your restorative.

She has hers on a necklace too. "Lady Melina gave it to me long ago."

"Well, then I don't see why we don't just take this siege apart ourselves," you say. "We find the lord commander, I put my sword through him."

"I'll do some scouting," Titania says. "You two find a Grace." She dismounts Squall and vanishes into the shadows.

You scout the skies for the glimmer of honeyed gold. "This way."

----

The Grace is nestled in-between rocks, but Nepheli is immediately on guard, and you follow her example. "_The bushes above. Crossbowmen. It's an ambush._"

You sneak your way up on the ridge above the Grace and true enough, visible against the glow of the Erdtree is a group of soldiers.

Calling on your sword, it glides from its scabbard on your back. You ready your shield and your rosary.

Then you send your blade flying, killing a man in an instant.

Your foes yell alarm, and crossbow bolts fly into the dark between the trees, missing completely. Nepheli flanks the group while you tear into them with dancing blade against the crossbows and concussive blasts of fire against the swordsmen who get close. Ten soldiers eliminated in two dozen heartbeats. Seven to you, three to Nepheli --- she swings her ax with terrifying force, cleaving through brigandine and rings like it was mere gambeson.

"Well fought," you say.

"And to you. I was very right to ask for your help," she says.

"There are few things I wouldn't do when a beautiful woman asks for help," you reply, knowing well the effect it might have on her.

Nepheli jumps off the escarpment, landing by the Grace. You climb down with more care. She sits down against one of the rocks, you take off your cloak, folding it up and laying it down to sit on.

"Melina."

Melina appears from a swirl of ash, looking lovely as ever, throwing back her hood. She notices Nepheli's presence and greets you "Jester," rather than by your name.

"Lady Melina," Nepheli greets.

"Nepheli Loux," Melina returns the greeting, then turns to you. "You're bare-faced?"

"Nameless' idea. My subjects must know my face."

She stands on her toes to kiss you. "Convenient."

You take a seat and pat your folded up cloak, take off your helm and cap, unclasping your pauldron and vambrace. Melina takes a seat and with some hesitance leans her head on your shoulder. You offer her a hand and she takes it, intertwining your fingers, and caressing your thumb with hers.

Compared to your passionate kissing in the church, this is a subtler kind of intimacy. At some point you will have to find a Grace with privacy, safety, and somewhere soft to lie down.

"You two are an item?" Nepheli asks.

"Yes," Melina says.

"... Interesting."

"Art thou envious, Nepheli Loux?" Melina presses.

"_Be nice,_" you whisper to her.

"No, no, not at all, I'm just surprised. I didn't think a mysterious maiden such as yourself would take lovers among Tarnished. Jester is a fine woman, I am happy for you."

Melina smiles. "Sounds like thou art not envious of Jester, but of me?"

"I--- no, not at all. Again, just happy for you."

She looks to you. "What are you planning? I thought you were heading for King Godrick?"

"We are. Nepheli has a contact in the noble family of Haight. The city is under seige, so we are going to break that siege, and recruit their help to march on Stormburg. That about right?"

Nepheli nods.

"Nameless is out scouting."

"I gathered."

She gives your hand a little squeeze. "I can't stay so long, love."

You put a finger on Melina's perfect cheek to turn her head and give her a kiss. Then she vanishes into ash.

"Too bad, huh?" Nepheli asks.

You strap your armor back on and throw your cloak over your shoulders. "Have you ever been in love?"

She's a little taken aback, by the sudden question, and doesn't answer. You look her dead in the eye. "It's pretty good."

"I should think so, yes."

----

Titania returns a bell or two before midnight. You've been dozing off a while, but never really finding rest, seeing glimpses of strange visions right when on the edge of sleep: Nepheli atop a throne.

"I've located the commanding encampment. It should not be a problem to sneak in and wreak havoc, then run away."

"Good," Nepheli says. She's up in an instant, and heading off with Titania.

You're a little slower to rise and stretch, gaze lingering on the ease and grace with which the other woman moves.

"Ezekiel."

You turn to see Melina stand.

"Melina."

She comes up to you, smiling, and rubs your cheek. "Listen. We don't have much time together, on account of my condition---"

"I'll find a way to---"

She silences you with a finger. "I know. But it took a toll on me to sit vigil by you in the Church of Vows, from which I've yet to recover. I also know you have _needs_ that I cannot readily fulfill. Needs that take _time_ and _endurance_ to sate."

"Melina, it's fine. I'm not some starving hound when it comes to---"

"Ah!" She silences you again. Then she looks in the direction of Nepheli. "Should we in our travels come across another woman you find alluring, I shall not be jealous if you decide to bed her. So long as I remain unwaveringly in thy heart, I am willing to share its many blessings with others."

Then she gives you a soft kiss before fading.

You hurry after them, and the way Nepheli looks at you with the barest impatience almost makes you blush in shame.

----

A half a league east, Titania steers you towards towards Haft once more. You dismount Torrent, and continue quietly on foot, though the murky woodlands of Limgrave, under the shine of the setting moon and the ever-present Erdtree.

There you come upon a fortified encampment. Palisades erect, bowmen and knights standing guard. Wood and canvas tents, the whole of it.

"_I have an idea,_" you whisper.

"_Yeah?_" Nepheli replies.

"_We set the whole place on fire._"

"_Fuck yeah,_" Titania mutters. "_Do it!_"

You ready your shield, let your sword fly from scabbard, and wade into the open. With a snap of your fingers, sparks fly with preternatural alacrity and land on the canvas tarps inside the palisades.

Then your sword runs a scrape across the wooden walls, scoring the trunks and leaving smoldering embers in the cuts that will soon become a conflagration.

"_Halt!_" A knight has noticed you, drawn his greatsword, and comes at you. As he goes to strike with his sword, you blind him with a gout of flame swirling around his shield and bring your blade around his guard, ripping through mail and coat with heat to melt steel.

Yelling sounds from inside the camp. "_Fire! Fire!_" "_Pull down the tents!_" "_Shovels!_" "_Find water!_"

The flames is a thing you can feel in the back of your mind.

Two archers come out the same way as the knight and you block their arrows by crouching behind your shield, then return the attack with your sword in a broad swipe, felling both of them.

You look to the treeline and gesture for your companions to enter the fray.

Titania charges ahead, leaping over the palisade entire behind you, and you know her landing inside by a thunderous tremor. You run inside through the gate, and Nepheli follows you close behind, ax and shield at the ready, and a gust of wind at her back.

Inside is bedlam, men running to and fro unarmed trying to put out the fires. "_Intruders!_" You make a broad spinning sweep of your blade, cutting down two. Nepheli sprints for a tent centrally placed, fully alight. You throw liquid flames at a crew of archers lining up to shoot you from across the yard, and look to Titania, seeing her skewering a man on her steel talons, holding him up as shield against a barrage of arrows.

Then you run inside after Nepheli, finding her held in a clash with a large man in knight's armor, holding back his greatsword with all her might behind shield and ax. Three dead men lie at the entrance to the tent, deep ax wounds in their heads.

The knight's sword is somehow wreathed in dark-red mists of strange flame. Nepheli's winds billow the tent above, fanning the fire in the canopy.

She shoves aside the knight's blade, but he follows up with a powerful kick to her shield, sending her careening back into a table. Coming up behind him, you spin low and sweep his legs with a strong heel kick, sending him to ground with a tremendous fall, and you hit him hard in his uncovered head with the edge of your shield, breaking his nose. You stomp hard on his sword hand, breaking bone in the wrist and leave him dazed on the floor --- Nepheli deserves the runes for this man's death.

Stepping over him, you offer Nepheli a hand to rise, and she puts the haft of her ax in your hand to pull her up. Then as soon as she's upright she yells "_watch out!_" and pulls you close to her, guarding your back with her shield against the knight's fell sword --- you only realize this has happened after she has spun you about to decapitate the man.

"Don't be so incautious, Jester. He nearly felled you." She turns to you, and as she does, you step _very_ close, putting your free right hand to her chin. "Good thing I had a beautiful warrior to protect me, then," you say.

A large scrap of burning fabric falls beside you.

"_Are you two quite done?!_" Titania yells from outside.

That gets you moving outside, where Titania is facing down a kind of monster familiar to you like an old nightmare. Too many legs and arms at odd angles, swords and shields.

"Grafted!" Nepheli yells. "Stay back, it is very dangerous!"

With no great desire to be impaled once more, you snap your fingers and concentrate your will to immolation into the tasseled tarps it wears. Instantly, the creature is enveloped in flame, and reacts quite accordingly: screaming horribly, dropping its blades and shield and and scampering off in a mad dash.

The remaining soldiers take that as the invitation to turn tail.

"Impressive!" Nepheli exclaims.

Then there's a distant deep sound, and Titania perks up, squinting skyward, stomps hard on the ground, digs her fingers into the soil and pulls a boulder from the stamped clay in a greats pray of earth. With a bestial roar she flings it skyward where it collides with an oncoming boulder on the way down. Sprays of stone and gravel rain about you --- Nepheli steps forth and swings her shield with a mighty gust, keeping the worst off the three of you.

"Let's get the hell out of here," Titania says, "before they reload that trebuchet."

-----

Your next move is to target the largest siege equipment --- Godrick's forces have constructed no less than nine trebuchets to gradually pummel the city into gravel. Your captain once told you of the war in his homeland, how sieges starved people to insanity and death. Here in the Lands Between, there is but one way win a siege: bombardment.

There's chaos already spreading through the ranks, as you locate the first one and sneak in from the back ranks. The fighting is as fierce as it is profitable to you in runes and detrimental to Godrick in lost men, and as soon as you are in range, with a snap of your fingers you ignite the stocks of great oil-filled pots, ending the siege weapon in a conflagration.

As soon as that is done, you retreat, and not a moment too soon as as an _actual giant_ comes barrelling in --- as tall as five men at least, with a great cavity where its belly should be.

With a gigantic bellow, it charges you. Nobody needs to yell 'run,' but you don't even get two dozen paces towards safety before a stinging pain in the knee sends you tumbling. Crossbow bolt.

Great strong hands pull you off the ground before you even come to a stop. "_Nepheli!_" Titania yells, and all but tosses you into her arms. Her embrace is strong and steady as she runs like the wind and you see Titania stay behind to dance around the giant's blows.

Nepheli gets you to safety out of the range of the crossbows, behind a rock formation.

You wince as she sets you down and grasps the shaft sticking out of your poplit. "I will pull the bolt, drink your restorative."

Readying the bottle, you give her a nod and she rips the barbed tip from your wound. A growl escapes between your gritted teeth, and you feel a spurt of blood run inside your gambeson trouser leg. Calling on a gout of fire with a snap of your fingers, you inflict even more pain on yourself by cauterizing the wound, hissing. Only then you drink and wait for the pain to abate.

You look at Nepheli, relaxing as the restorative takes hold. "Not gonna lambast me for being incautious, are you?"

"Of course not."

"Twice in one night."

"Let us hope it does not become three." She leaps up on the rock, looking into the darkness. "Where is Nameless?"

"Titania."

She looks down at you.

"That's the name I gave her. I'm Ezekiel; my father named me so."

"That's nice, but are you sure she'll be alright fighting that troll by herself?"

There's a great roar out there.

"Quite."

Nepheli remains on the lookout until you're back on your feet, and it's not long before Titania comes out of the darkness, clutching her left arm, hanging limp.

You're on her in a heartbeat, all but ignoring your lingering limp. "What happened?"

"Messed up, had to stop a punch. Messed up my shoulder. The golden medicine didn't help."

"I can help," Nepheli says immediately. "Father saw me educated in medicine."

Together, help Titania doff her armor, then keep watch while Nepheli examines the injury. "Dislocation," is her conclusion, and she bids Nameless lie down and with a gentle rotation and a hiss of pain from Titania, betters the problem. "Drink mine," she says, handing her golden bottle to Titania.

"Let's retreat for now, as our flasks are all empty," you say. "I should think this proves the utility of having them on hand."

There's a great big bellow out there in the darkness, and thundering footsteps. You look to Titania.

"What? It messed up my arm! Of course I didn't _kill_ it!"

"Start with that next time," Nepheli says.

You whistle for Torrent, and make haste away from the battlefield.

----

Finding a Grace, nice and far from the action, in a grove of pine. Titania secures the perimeter and then comes to you by the honeyed mote of light.

"I need to go see my teacher."

You sense her concern, her guilt. "What about?"

"We parted ways before he could teach me how to fell foes larger than myself. I overestimated my own strength, relied on brute force rather than cunning. I nearly got myself killed for no reason other than hubris."

"Then go. When will you be back?"

"Tomorrow."

You give her a hug and kiss her forehead, then she steps through Grace.

"Three times, now," you say, turning to Nepheli. "Can't keep going like this, or I'll be indebted to you forever."

"The two of you are as reckless as you are terrifyingly powerful." She has found a seat against one of the trunks next to the Grace, and is removing her vambraces and pauldrons. "Having you indebted to me does not sound bad."

She has laid her golden flask by the Grace. You do the same, then you remove your helmet and start doffing your armor, same as her. 

Nepheli is beautiful, strong, and clever, and while there's few things you'd rather do than resume teasing her and explore just how mutual your fancying her is, some part of you urges caution. Her father is a powerful man, and her loyalties are complex.

You stow your plate in Torrent's saddlebags and take a seat next to Nepheli, who has now, too, doffed down to her gambeson.

"What's your ambition?"

"Hm?"

"You're Tarnished, guided by Grace, yeah? Am I going to have to kill you for the Elden Ring one day?"

"No. My father will take that title --- sorry, I mean, you are looking to become Elden Lord too, I didn't mean to imply---"

"Don't worry. It's in the far future. But what do _you_ want?"

"My father has promised me to bring justice to the Lands Between. Whatever part I can play in that, is what I want."

"Justice for _whom?_" you press.

"The downtrodden shall never be cheated again. Your Titania, she is Lord of Morne. My father would see the city of Morning recognized as haven for chimera and protected from usurpation by the Golden Order. If he finds a way, he will shine grace upon them, too."

You nod slowly.

"It's part of why I trust you. Your goals and mine are the same, or so I understand."

"Sounds like your father and I see eye-to-eye, then. Good. I will have use of someone like him when I take the throne. Sorry, 'if' I take the throne. I didn't mean to imply---"

Nepheli giggles. It's a nice sound. You look at her.

She meets your gaze, and linger. Then she looks away, blushing.

"You're very beautiful, Nepheli."

"You're too kind, Ezekiel." She scoots away from you. "Though I must rebuff your advances. I will not be party to your infidelity to Lady Melina."

As called, she appears from a swirl of ash, sitting to Nepheli's other side.

"What makes you think I do not explicitly encourage it?"

Nepheli all but jumps in surprise.

"The truth is, Fair Lady Loux, I am barely corporeal as is. I can linger long enough for a kiss or a caress, but not more than that. So..."

And then she leans forward and beckons you to her. You roll to your knees and meet her in a kiss before fading.

"_She's all yours, if you want her,_" Melina's voice says like a whisper in the wind.

You look at Nepheli, who looks back at you with mute surprise, almost fear, but also a deep heat in her cheeks --- something you just now notice you can sense like a small flame. Heat in her cheeks, desire in her breath. It sings to you like fire.

With only this as your invitation, feeling her passion kindle yours, you seat yourself astride her lap. "Do you?" She seems to regain some cool, and puts her hands on your waist.

"Do I?" Nepheli asks.

"Want me? Despite the contrivances?"

She looks at you for a beat. Then with her tremendous strength rolls both of you over, landing you in the soft pine needles, with her atop you. She kisses you, as if to taste your lips, and then finding the taste pleasing, she pushes you into the ground with a hand and her leg between yours. "I'm loath to share, but I suppose I'll have to learn."

You're at a loss for words, but it's not a problem as she quickly takes your breath away with another kiss, and then another, and another... you get a leg under yourself and push you both into rolling over with you on top of her.

"Let's actually make camp and get undressed," you say, patting her cheek, "then I'll teach you a thing or two."

"Camp?" Nepheli asks with a snort. "Why not just hop over to the Roundtable? Half the bedchambers are unoccupied."

-----

Southwest, down the upstairs corridor where Fia doesn't lurk, into the first bedchamber with a bed not soiled or in disarray. Nepheli shuts the door and you push her against it. She smells of sweat and of blood and of fire --- your fire --- of _war_ as a warrior should. Her lips bear scars where battle and the elements has seen them split. She has freckles and eyes so very, very dark.

You both have steady hands and know well how to be rid of doublets and thick linen trousers and armwraps and undershirts and braies and breastbands and loincloths... As you tumble together into the bed, giggling like girls, you spy Melina appear for but a moment by the door, laying a golden seal on it and blowing you a kiss.

Nepheli's hands are strong, and her will stronger. Her sex is hot, but your breath is hotter; her fingers are strong, but your needs are deep; the bells pass, but neither of you are easily sated.

She enjoys your nails on her back and your teeth in her shoulder. You enjoy her lips on your breasts, and thigh against your womanhood. The whole Hold knows --- neither of you are quiet lovers.

-----

You lie, kicking your legs in the air, tracing along the contours of Nepheli's breasts with a finger. "Thank you," you say, quietly.

"And to you."

Her tone is pensive.

"What is weighting on your mind?"

Nepheli shakes her head. "It was good, just... I don't think it's for me."

"Women."

"Sharing. Not that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this, just... your heart is with another. Mine can't quite accept that, I think. I... I want to whisper 'I love you' to my lovers."

"And you feel you can't love me because I love Melina."

"Yes."

You nod solemnly. "That I understand and respect."

"I want you to understand that I did not know this before we---"

"I get it, Nepheli. I am not hurt," you say, and crawl up to kiss her brow. "I'll pray that you find someone, some day, who will have only you in their heart, and you, them in yours."

"Pray he or she will be as skilled a lover as you, more like," she says.

"_He?_"

She looks at you. "Yes?"

"Huh."

"What?"

You shake your head and smile. "Nothing." People truly are very different. You couldn't possibly ever imagine intimacy with a man --- but if Nepheli can, all power to her. There's vastly many more men who love women.

----

Back to the Grace in the grove of pine finds Titania already waiting for you. She sits, almost glaring at the gold, visible even in the noon sun filtered through the needle canopies above.

As you appear, she looks up. "Oh. Hey. Figured you'd gone to the Hold."

"Yeah," you say.

"Had fun, I assume?"

"We did," Nepheli replies. "But don't worry, it was just the once."

Titania looks to you, eyebrow raised.

"By mutual agreement," you clarify. "Titania?"

"Yeah?"

"What's wrong?"

"Gurranq is... having an episode. He's... sick, somehow. I don't understand quite how. Consuming the deathroot helps, but sometimes it doesn't. Anyway, he taught me what I needed, it was just..."

She gets up and you stop her with a hand.

"You're worried about your teacher. You don't need to hide it --- if you want to talk about it..."

"Yeah." Titania pulls you into a quick hug. "The siege is in disarray and I want a rematch with that troll."

"Melina?" you ask.

"Ezekiel," she appears.

"Lady Melina," Nepheli greets her.

"Lady Loux," Melina replies in kind.

You give her a quick peck on the cheek. "Runes for strength, all three of us."

"Always."

-----

By the light of day, you make another two successful raids against the siege, taking out two more of the great trebuchets. Titania tracks down the troll and you watch her swing herself onto the giant, climbing it effortlessly and severing its head as the killing blow.

A breakout force from within Haft stages an attack against a weakened part of the perimeter, men at arms clashing _en-masse._ Godrick's regiments rout as the cavalry charges and the siege is broken.

In the aftermath, Nepheli guides you to seek the leading regiment of cavalry. There, one of the knights greet them, pulling up his visor even as Nepheli takes off her helmet. He seems not quite as grand as the others, even if his brigandine is in even brighter heraldic tinctures. His spear is bloody, though.

"Lady Loux, what a pleasant surprise."

"Lord Haight. Good to see you well and victorious."

"Ah, well, a Lord has to ride vanguard to defend his city, does he not?"

"Some would say he does not," Nepheli replies.

"I assume you and these two companions of yours had a hand in the attacks on the siege camps during the night?"

"You assume correct."

Lord Haight dismounts and comes up to greet you with a bow. "Kenneth Haight, lord of Haft. You have my deepest gratitude."

"These are Jester Fire-Keeper, and Nameless, Lord of Morne" Nepheli presents you to him.

Kenneth perks up. "Why, Lord of Morne? Ah, so there was a rebellion, finally?"

"What?" Titania asks.

"Forgive me for assuming. I've long held in low esteem the practices of the rulership of Morning; since you are chimeric---"

"Well, yes," Titania says. "My brother led it. Unfortunately he was ill fit to power, so... the title passed to me."

Kenneth nods. "Good. I assume it is a dire matter forcing you away from home."

"I'm Tarnished," you say. "With the guidance of Grace, we travel to Morning regularly for Nameless to see to her vassals' government."

Kenneth nods. "Ah, I see. Clever. Very good, very good. Please, follow me. I know why you are here, and we have much to discuss."

-----

Haft is a city quite unlike Morning: flat. The houses that still stand are two or three storeys tall, and daylight comes equally down on all streets.

The people here are more alike Morning. Here, beings that you've never seen before, walk along with humans, wearing clothes and doing work --- much work to be done hauling rubble and corpses.

"_Demi-humans, they're called,_" Titania supplies, "_kobolds, they call themselves._"

"Quite right," Kenneth says, having overheard. "Haft is a haven-city to the kobold populations of southeastern Limgrave. "
