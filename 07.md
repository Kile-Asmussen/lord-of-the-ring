Nepheli leads you through grace to somewhere seemingly in Limgrave.

"Where are we, then?"

"Southern Limgrave. I've a contact to meet up with --- toppling King Godrick will necessitate enabling a new dynasty in his place. The house of Haight has long been critical of the crown of Limgrave, and rule over the second-largest city in the land, Haft."

You whistle for Torrent, and Titania for Squall.

"Got a horse?" Titania asks Nepheli.

"Never needed one." She sets into a light-footed jog, despite her amor, pack, and shield and ax strapped to her back. Like a deer darting through the forest.

"Down girl," Titania mutters to you. "Already got a girl, remember?"

"Doesn't mean I must blind my eyes to beauty when I see it, just that I keep my hands to myself," you retort, and spur Torrent into a trot.

You ride through the morning and over noon, taking shortcuts by descending steep escarpments rather than following the roads --- Nepheli can take jumps that should kill mortal men and land in gusts of wind much like Torrent and Squall.

"I could probably do that too, you know," Titania says.

"You don't need to be jealous, love," you reply. "Maybe you should ask her to teach you a thing or two about mastering the wind."

By nightfall you draw close to the city, and on a hill overlooking the slopes towards the sea, you see a circle of bonfires around the outer walls.

"A siege? No. Fuck!" Nepheli says.

"What's the matter?" Titania asks.

"Godrick has sent his armies to eliminate the competition," you venture. "But is it that much of a problem? Nepheli are you strong?"

She looks at you. "I can hold my own in a fight against ten men."

"Good. Do you have one of these?" You hold out your restorative.

She has hers on a necklace too. "Lady Melina gave it to me long ago."

"Well, then I don't see why we don't just take this siege apart ourselves," you say. "We find the lord commander, I put my sword through him."

"I'll do some scouting," Titania says. "You two find a grace." She dismounts Squall and vanishes into the shadows.

You scout the skies for the glimmer of Grace. "This way."

----

The grace is nestled in-between rocks, but Nepheli is immediately on guard, and you follow her example. "_The bushes above. Crossbowmen. It's an ambush._"

You sneak your way up on the ridge above the grace and true enough, visible against the glow of the Erdtree is a group of soldiers.

Calling on your sword, it glides from its scabbard on your back. You ready your shield and your rosary.

Then you send your blade flying, killing a man in an instant.

Your foes yell alarm, and crossbow bolts fly into the dark between the trees, missing completely. Nepheli flanks the group while you tear into them with dancing blade against the crossbows and concussive blasts of fire against the swordsmen who get close. Ten soldiers eliminated in two dozen heartbeats. Seven to you, three to Nepheli --- she swings her ax with terrifying force, cleaving through brigandine and rings like it was mere gambeson.

"Well fought," you say.

"And to you. I was very right to ask for your help," she says.

"There are few things I wouldn't do when a beautiful woman asks for help," you reply, knowing well the effect it might have on her.

Nepheli jumps off the escarpment, landing by the Grace. You climb down with more care. She sits down against one of the rocks, you take off your cloak, folding it up and laying it down to sit on.

"Melina."

Melina appears from a swirl of ash, looking lovely as ever, throwing back her hood. She notices Nepheli's presence and greets you "Jester," rather than by your name.

"Lady Melina," Nepheli greets.

"Nepheli Loux," Melina returns greeting then turns to you. "You're bare-faced?"

"Nameless' idea. My subjects must know my face."

She stands on her toes to kiss you. "Convenient."

You take a seat and pat your folded up cloak, take off your helm and cap, unclasping your pauldron and vambrace. Melina takes a seat and with some hesitance leans her head on your shoulder. You offer her a hand and she takes it, intertwining your fingers, and caressing your thumb with hers.

Compared to your passionate kissing in the church, this is a subtler kind of intimacy. At some point you will have to find a Grace with privacy, safety, and somewhere soft to lie down.

"You two are an item?" Nepheli asks.

"Yes," Melina says.

"... Interesting."

"Art thou envious, Nepheli Loux?" Melina presses.

"_Be nice,_" you whisper to her.

"No, no, not at all, I'm just surprised. I didn't think a mysterious maiden such as yourself would take lovers among Tarnished. Jester is a fine woman, I am happy for you."

Melina smiles. "Sounds like thou art not envious of Jester, but of me?"

"I--- no, not at all. Again, just happy for you."

She looks to you. "What are you planning? I thought you were heading for King Godrick?"

"We are. Nepheli has a contact in the noble family of Haight. The city is under seige, so we are going to break that siege, and recruit their help to march on Stormburg. That about right?"

Nepheli nods.

"Nameless is out scouting."

"I gathered."

She gives your hand a little squeeze. "I can't stay so long, love."

You put a finger on Melina's perfect cheek to turn her head and give her a kiss. Then she vanishes into ash.

"Too bad, huh?" Nepheli asks.

You strap your armor back on and throw your cloak over your shoulders. "Have you ever been in love?"

She's a little taken aback, by the sudden question, and doesn't answer. You look her dead in the eye. "It's pretty good."

"I should think so, yes."
