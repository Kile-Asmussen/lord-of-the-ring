Nepheli leads you through grace to somewhere seemingly in Limgrave.

"Where are we, then?"

"Southern Limgrave. I've a contact to meet up with --- toppling King Godrick will necessitate enabling a new dynasty in his place. The house of Haight has long been critical of the crown of Limgrave, and rule over the second-largest city in the land, Haft."

You whistle for Torrent, and Titania for Squall.

"Got a horse?" Titania asks Nepheli.

"Never needed one." She sets into a light-footed jog, despite her amor, pack, and shield and ax strapped to her back. Like a deer darting through the forest.

"Down, woman," Titania mutters to you. "Already got a girl of your own, remember?"

"Doesn't mean I must blind my eyes to beauty when I see it, just that I keep my hands to myself," you retort, and spur Torrent into a trot.

You ride through the morning and over noon, taking shortcuts by descending steep escarpments rather than following the roads --- Nepheli can take jumps that should kill mortal men and land in gusts of wind much like Torrent and Squall.

"I could probably do that too, you know," Titania says.

"You don't need to be jealous, love," you reply. "Maybe you should ask her to teach you a thing or two about mastering the wind."

By nightfall you draw close to the city, and on a hill overlooking the slopes towards the sea, you see a circle of bonfires around the outer walls.

"A siege? No. Fuck!" Nepheli says.

"What's the matter?" Titania asks.

"Godrick has sent his armies to eliminate the competition," you venture. "But is it that much of a problem? Nepheli are you strong?"

She looks at you. "I can hold my own in a fight against ten men."

"Good. Do you have one of these?" You hold out your restorative.

She has hers on a necklace too. "Lady Melina gave it to me long ago."

"Well, then I don't see why we don't just take this siege apart ourselves," you say. "We find the lord commander, I put my sword through him."

"I'll do some scouting," Titania says. "You two find a Grace." She dismounts Squall and vanishes into the shadows.

You scout the skies for the glimmer of honeyed gold. "This way."

----

The Grace is nestled in-between rocks, but Nepheli is immediately on guard, and you follow her example. "_The bushes above. Crossbowmen. It's an ambush._"

You sneak your way up on the ridge above the Grace and true enough, visible against the glow of the Erdtree is a group of soldiers.

Calling on your sword, it glides from its scabbard on your back. You ready your shield and your rosary.

Then you send your blade flying, killing a man in an instant.

Your foes yell alarm, and crossbow bolts fly into the dark between the trees, missing completely. Nepheli flanks the group while you tear into them with dancing blade against the crossbows and concussive blasts of fire against the swordsmen who get close. Ten soldiers eliminated in two dozen heartbeats. Seven to you, three to Nepheli --- she swings her ax with terrifying force, cleaving through brigandine and rings like it was mere gambeson.

"Well fought," you say.

"And to you. I was very right to ask for your help," she says.

"There are few things I wouldn't do when a beautiful woman asks for help," you reply, knowing well the effect it might have on her.

Nepheli jumps off the escarpment, landing by the Grace. You climb down with more care. She sits down against one of the rocks, you take off your cloak, folding it up and laying it down to sit on.

"Melina."

Melina appears from a swirl of ash, looking lovely as ever, throwing back her hood. She notices Nepheli's presence and greets you "Jester," rather than by your name.

"Lady Melina," Nepheli greets.

"Nepheli Loux," Melina returns the greeting, then turns to you. "You're bare-faced?"

"Nameless' idea. My subjects must know my face."

She stands on her toes to kiss you. "Convenient."

You take a seat and pat your folded up cloak, take off your helm and cap, unclasping your pauldron and vambrace. Melina takes a seat and with some hesitance leans her head on your shoulder. You offer her a hand and she takes it, intertwining your fingers, and caressing your thumb with hers.

Compared to your passionate kissing in the church, this is a subtler kind of intimacy. At some point you will have to find a Grace with privacy, safety, and somewhere soft to lie down.

"You two are an item?" Nepheli asks.

"Yes," Melina says.

"... Interesting."

"Art thou envious, Nepheli Loux?" Melina presses.

"_Be nice,_" you whisper to her.

"No, no, not at all, I'm just surprised. I didn't think a mysterious maiden such as yourself would take lovers among Tarnished. Jester is a fine woman, I am happy for you."

Melina smiles. "Sounds like thou art not envious of Jester, but of me?"

"I--- no, not at all. Again, just happy for you."

She looks to you. "What are you planning? I thought you were heading for King Godrick?"

"We are. Nepheli has a contact in the noble family of Haight. The city is under seige, so we are going to break that siege, and recruit their help to march on Stormburg. That about right?"

Nepheli nods.

"Nameless is out scouting."

"I gathered."

She gives your hand a little squeeze. "I can't stay so long, love."

You put a finger on Melina's perfect cheek to turn her head and give her a kiss. Then she vanishes into ash.

"Too bad, huh?" Nepheli asks.

You strap your armor back on and throw your cloak over your shoulders. "Have you ever been in love?"

She's a little taken aback, by the sudden question, and doesn't answer. You look her dead in the eye. "It's pretty good."

"I should think so, yes."

----

Titania returns a bell or two before dawn. You've been dozing off a while, but never really finding rest, seeing glimpses of strange visions right when on the edge of sleep. <!-- which visions? -->

"I've located the commanding encampment. It should not be a problem to sneak in and wreak havoc, then run away."

"Good," Nepheli says. She's up in an instant, and heading off with Titania.

You're a little slower to rise and stretch.

"Ezekiel."

You turn to see Melina stand.

"Melina."

She comes up to you, smiling, and rubs your cheek. "Listen. We don't have much time together, on account of my condition---"

"I'll find a way to---"

She silences you with a finger. "I know. But it took a toll on me to sit vigil by you in the Church of Vows, from which I've yet to recover. I also know you have _needs_ that I cannot readily fulfill. Needs that take _time_ and _endurance_ to sate."

"Melina, it's fine. I'm not some starving hound when it comes to---"

"Ah!" She silences you again. Then she looks in the direction of Nepheli. "Should we in our travels come across another woman you find alluring, I shall not be jealous if you decide to bed her. So long as I remain unwaveringly in thy heart, I am willing to share its many blessings with others."

Then she gives you a soft kiss before fading.

----

A half a league east, Titania steers you towards towards Haft once more. You dismount Torrent, and continue quietly on foot, though the murky woodlands of Limgrave, under the shine of the setting moon and the ever-present Erdtree.

There you come upon a fortified encampment. Palisades erect, bowmen and knights standing guard. Wood and canvas tents, the whole of it.

"_I have an idea,_" you whisper.

"_Yeah?_" Nepheli replies.

"_We set the whole place on fire._"

"_Fuck yeah,_" Titania mutters. "_Do it!_"

You ready your shield, let your sword fly from scabbard, and wade into the open. With a snap of your fingers, sparks fly with preternatural alacrity and land on the canvas tarps inside the palisades.

Then your sword runs a scrape across the wooden walls, scoring the trunks and leaving smoldering embers in the cuts that will soon become a conflagration.

"_Halt!_" A knight has noticed you, drawn his greatsword, and comes at you. As he goes to strike with his sword, you blind him with a gout of flame swirling around his shield and bring your blade around his guard, ripping through mail and coat with heat to melt steel.

Yelling sounds from inside the camp. "_Fire! Fire!_" "_Pull down the tents!_" "_Shovels!_" "_Find water!_"

The flames is a thing you can feel in the back of your mind.

Two archers come out the same way as the knight and you block their arrows by crouching behind your shield, then return the attack with your sword in a broad swipe, felling both of them.

You look to the treeline and gesture for your companions to enter the fray.

Titania charges ahead, leaping over the palisade entire behind you, and you know her landing inside by a thunderous tremor. You run inside through the gate, and Nepheli follows you close behind, ax and shield at the ready, and a gust of wind at her back.

Inside is bedlam, men running to and fro unarmed trying to put out the fires. "_Intruders!_" You make a broad spinning sweep of your blade, cutting down two. Nepheli sprints for a tent centrally placed, fully alight. You throw liquid flames at a crew of archers lining up to shoot you from across the yard, and look to Titania, seeing her skewering a man on her steel talons, holding him up as shield against a barrage of arrows.

Then you run inside after Nepheli, finding her held in a clash with a large man in knight's armor, holding back his greatsword with all her might behind shield and ax. Three dead men lie at the entrance to the tent, deep ax wounds in their heads.

The knight's sword is somehow wreathed in dark-red mists of strange flame. Nepheli's winds billow the tent above, fanning the fire in the canopy.

She shoves aside the knight's blade, but he follows up with a powerful kick to her shield, sending her careening back into a table. Coming up behind him, you spin low and sweep his legs with a strong heel kick, sending him to ground with a tremendous fall, and you hit him hard in his uncovered head with the edge of your shield, breaking his nose. You stomp hard on his sword hand, breaking bone in the wrist and leave him dazed on the floor --- Nepheli deserves the runes for this man's death.

Stepping over him, you offer Nepheli a hand to rise, and she puts the haft of her ax in your hand to pull her up. Then as soon as she's upright she yells "_watch out!_" and pulls you close to her, guarding your back with her shield against the knight's fell sword --- you only realize this has happened after she has spun you about to decapitate the man.

"Don't be so incautious, Jester. He nearly felled you." She turns to you, and as she does, you step _very_ close, putting your free right hand to her chin. "Good thing I had a beautiful warrior to protect me, then," you say.

A large scrap of burning fabric falls beside you.

"_Are you two quite done?!_" Titania yells from outside.

That gets you moving outside, where Titania is facing down a kind of monster familiar to you like an old nightmare. Too many legs and arms at odd angles, swords and shields.

"Grafted!" Nepheli yells. "Stay back, it is very dangerous!"

With no great desire to be impaled once more, you snap your fingers and concentrate your will to immolation into the tasseled tarps it wears. Instantly, the creature is enveloped in flame, and reacts quite accordingly: screaming horribly, dropping its blades and shield and and scampering off in a mad dash.
