# The Best Invention Since Sharp Rocks

You reach your destination in the lush mesas of eastern Liurnia. To the west lies the vast swamps and the city of Luke built on the islands of rock and even into the swamplands themselves, under the watchful eye of the sorcerer-governors of Raya Lucaria, where sits the ruler of Liurnia, the immortal Carian Queen Rennala.

But you are here for the Cultists of Flame, who live in a village on the edge of a rock shelf, from where the ocean is visible in the far distance.

A strong man in red robes approaches you, wielding a mace. "Halt. For what purpose do you come here?"

Corhyn steps forward. "We come in peace. I am Brother Corhyn a man of the cloth; this here is my disciple, Jester. She wishes to learn the way of the flame. I have taught her but what little I know."

The guardsman looks to you. You hold out a hand and conjure a fuel-less flame above your palm.

"We do not take inductions without introduction."

You know he will refuse you thrice. "I may be Tarnished, but you will find me a capable student."

"Your flame is weak."

"One adds fuel and air to weak flames to make them strong."

"We preach heresy, the holyman wishes to see you branded."

"I trust him, he is a good man."

The guard looks you up and down. "Come with, Jester. I will see you to the clothier --- blue is not our color. Brother Corhyn, you may stay as a guest if you can earn your keep."

"I know a healing miracle, I am literate, and I am no stranger to doing work, so long as it is not objectionable."

Through grace, to the swamps. Revenants lurk there.

Dee joins Titania, with two other knights of Gurranq.

A great grotesque being of too many arms, spitting poison and fast like an ill wind.

By a gesture and a prayer, she rips stones from a ruin sunk into the mud, throwing them with thunderous force. Her clawed gauntlet rends flesh with blades of wind.

Dee summons holy light, the other knights wield flame and a great hammer. A fierce and terrible hunt.

They winnow the deathroot and burn the stump in cleansing fire.

Melina comes as called, trading runes for strength in Titania. They talk for a spell, but you cannot hear what about.

Gurranq accepts the offering, devouring the foul plant.

You spend many days in meditation, many days conjuring fire, felling trees and cutting lumber, working the charcoal kilns, and participating in the ritual of emberwalking. You sit disciple to the great pyromancers, learning to turn flame to liquid, to force, and even to cleansing and purification and healing warmth. You learn to extinguish a bonfire with a gesture, and ignite one at twenty paces with a snap of your fingers.

The old crone flame reader calls you a 'kindler' and a 'keeper of fire.' You practice with the heat of dragons which Hewg put inside your father's sword. The fire helps your preparations, hastening the extractions of useful essences from herbs and animals. Intimacy with heat also makes you better at cooking meals, somehow.

Corhyn tells stories to the children, tills the fields, and heals the injured.

At the end of two moons, you feel much strengthened --- though not through runes --- prepared to return, and you miss your Shadow quite terribly. Out there you feel Titania must have the same instinct.

You bid a very fond farewell to your new friends, and you and Corhyn head onto the road once more.

"We could travel straight to the Roundtable Hold."

"There's a church I wish to visit, a little north of here."

So you set out on another day's travel, through fair Liurnia, seeing wolfpacks on the prowl and great natural stone pillars toppled.

By night, atop a twisting path, lies another ruin. "Why are all the churches in ruin?"

"There was a war," he says, and unhelpfully elaborates: "No reason to rebuild them. They feel almost holier this way."

Inside is no holy place. You feel the animosity, the killing intent, before even entering, drawing your sword.

There you find a terrible scene. A man in dark armor stands, holding a bloody sword, over the corpse of a traveling merchant. He is inspecting something in his hand. In the corner lies a gigantic turtle shell, with gouges carved in it.

You sneak up on him, with all the quiet you can muster. Then you step on a stone that scratches against another.

"_Hey!_" Corhyn yells, saving you --- he has run around the outside and found a section of collapsed wall. "This is a house of worship! How dare you murder here!" He steps out, knife drawn from belt, and a hidden blade drawn from his cane.

The knight twirls his sword.

You plunge yours into the back of his knee.

He growls in pain, and his sword does something you can barely comprehend. It fliest form his hand, aglow in crimson, and flies directly at you. Parrying knocks you off-balance by the brute force of the blow. The knight stands on his good leg and with a gesture catches the blade again. You dance back and ready a handful of liquid fire.

As you throw, the flying sword swipes you across the chest, ripping through bone, slicing your collarbone, sternum, and ribs. Instinctively you conjure fire in your hand and cauterize the wound.

The knight gets doused in slick fire, his brigandine catching flame, but readies a killing blow regardless.

With your last strength you throw your sword and guide the fire inside. His breastplate gives out like white-hot iron under a chisel, and your father's blade burns a path through his heart.

Then you collapse.

Titania gallops for a Grace in unfamiliar lands, seeking desperately a mote of gold, unable to see the guidance of it.

You wake to the taste of healing draught on your lips. Your head rests softly on thighs of someone, and as you open your eyes, you see Melina over you.

"Welcome back, Jester. We almost lost you."

"Melina?" You feel weak and look aside to see Corhyn standing next to a giant grey turtle, wearing an arch priest's headdress. "What happened?"

"You killed the infamous Bell Bearing Hunter and suffered a bane wound. Miriel there held you to life with a healing miracle. I sent Corhyn out on Torrent to find a golden seed and sacred tear. I brewed a restorative, and it has brought you back to life. Where is the one I gave you?"

"Lent it to Titania."

She smiles. "Of course."

"I owe you my life, once more, fair Melina."

"If you die, who will bring me to the Erdtree?"

Your eyelids feel heavy. "I am very tired."

"Then sleep, noble Ezekiel. We will watch over you. Titania will be here shortly."

-----

You wake, feeling drained, to the familiar feeling of Titania's presence.

She sits by your side.

"Hey."

"Hey."

"Sorry."

"What for?"

"Not being here to save you."

"No, I'm sorry."

"What?"

"I should never have risked myself without you here."

You reach out --- you wish you could reach her face, but you settle for her hand. She takes yours in both of hers.

"It's good to see you."

She chuckles. "Likewise. Let's never do this again, yeah?" A tear rolls down Titania's cheek. She wipes it away, and sniffles hard. "Sorry. I don't know why I'm suddenly so emotional. You're alive."

"It's okay. We've been apart for two moons."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

She bends down to kiss your forehead. "My lord."

"My knight."

You push yourself up to sit, seeing Melina by the Grace --- she seems ill at ease, and flecks of ash seems to drift about her. Corhyn sits with a fire going, inexpertly cooking slices of meat on your skillet. With some struggle, you get up to stand, and Titania supports you.

"Melina, you should go --- staying here so long is taxing on you, is it not?"

"Do y---you not have runes?" She looks to you, smiling.

You do. A vast bounty. "Two thirds."

She takes your hand, and you feel strength return in a _major_ way.

"Jester," she says and evaporates.

You sit by the grace, feeling relief wash over you, and lay your restorative flask by the honeyed golden radiance. Corhyn offers you the pan, and you skewer a sliver of meat, blowing on it to cool the hot, slightly charred flesh.

"Pardon me."

Behind you, the great turtle Miriel has somehow snuck close. 

"I couldn't help but notice the bond you have with that maiden."

"Melina is a friend."

"I surmise, but... forgive an old romantic. This is the Church of Vows. I am Miriel, Pastor of Vows, steward of these sacred chambers."

You look up at the lack of roof, but say nothing.

"It is here, in this very holy ground, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. And so my church held in view the monuments of both houses. The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Here I officated the union of Radagon of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala of House Caria. I can tell you much more if you wish, but I am therefore cognizant of love when I see it."

You look into the fire, rather than the Grace. Of course you find Melina near breathtakingly beautiful, no wonder that you'd fall for her. "Wait, are you saying Melina---?"

"Maid Melina most certainly feels deep fondness for you," Miriel says sagely. "She sat by you the whole time, stroking your forehead and muttering prayers for you."

"He's right," Titania says, coming over to you with an armful of looted possessions from the dead knight. The dead merchant's stock, she has left well enough alone. "I spoke to her a few times. She likes you. A lot. That's why she stayed so long, even if it pained her --- she's not long for this world when she shows herself. She wanted to see you wake."

"Extraordinary," Corhyn says. "To think Melina of all people... I suppose the sheer number of Tarnished she must have helped over the ages, it was bound to happen."

You feel oddly light in your chest.
