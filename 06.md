# The Best Invention Since Sharp Rocks

You reach your destination in the lush mesas of eastern Liurnia. To the west lies the vast swamps and the city of Luke built on the islands of rock and even into the swamplands themselves, under the watchful eye of the sorcerer-governors of Raya Lucaria, where sits the ruler of Liurnia, the immortal Carian Queen Rennala.

But you are here for the Cultists of Flame, who live in a village on the edge of a rock shelf, from where the ocean is visible in the far distance.

A strong man in red robes approaches you, wielding a mace. "Halt. For what purpose do you come here?"

Corhyn steps forward. "We come in peace. I am Brother Corhyn a man of the cloth; this here is my disciple, Jester. She wishes to learn the way of the flame. I have taught her but what little I know."

The guardsman looks to you. You hold out a hand and conjure a fuel-less flame above your palm.

"We do not take inductions without introduction."

You know he will refuse you thrice. "I may be Tarnished, but you will find me a capable student."

"Your flame is weak."

"One adds fuel and air to weak flames to make them strong."

"We preach heresy, the holyman wishes to see you branded."

"I trust him, he is a good man."

The guard looks you up and down. "Come with, Jester. I will see you to the clothier --- blue is not our color. Brother Corhyn, you may stay as a guest if you can earn your keep."

"I know a healing miracle, I am literate, and I am no stranger to doing work, so long as it is not objectionable."

Through grace, to the swamps. Revenants lurk there.

Dee joins Titania, with two other knights of Gurranq.

A great grotesque being of too many arms, spitting poison and fast like an ill wind.

By a gesture and a prayer, she rips stones from a ruin sunk into the mud, throwing them with thunderous force. Her clawed gauntlet rends flesh with blades of wind.

Dee summons holy light, the other knights wield flame and a great hammer. A fierce and terrible hunt.

They winnow the deathroot and burn the stump in cleansing fire.

Melina comes as called, trading runes for strength in Titania. They talk for a spell, but you cannot hear what about.

Gurranq accepts the offering, devouring the foul plant.

-----

You spend many days in meditation, many days conjuring fire, felling trees and cutting lumber, working the charcoal kilns, and participating in the ritual of emberwalking. You sit disciple to the great pyromancers, learning to turn flame to liquid, to force, and even to cleansing and purification and healing warmth. You learn to extinguish a bonfire with a gesture, and ignite one at twenty paces with a snap of your fingers.

The old crone flame reader calls you a 'kindler' and a 'keeper of fire.' You practice with the heat of dragons which Hewg put inside your father's sword. The fire helps your preparations, hastening the extractions of useful essences from herbs and animals. Intimacy with heat also makes you better at cooking meals, somehow.

Corhyn tells stories to the children, tills the fields, and heals the injured.

At the end of two moons, you feel much strengthened --- though not through runes --- prepared to return, and you miss your Shadow quite terribly. Out there you feel Titania must have the same instinct.

You bid a very fond farewell to your new friends, and you and Corhyn head onto the road once more.

"We could travel straight to the Roundtable Hold."

"There's a church I wish to visit, a little north of here."

So you set out on another day's travel, through fair Liurnia, seeing wolfpacks on the prowl and great natural stone pillars toppled.

By night, atop a twisting path, lies another ruin. "Why are all the churches in ruin?"

"There was a war," he says, and unhelpfully elaborates: "No reason to rebuild them. They feel almost holier this way."

Inside is no holy place. You feel the animosity, the killing intent, before even entering, drawing your sword.

There you find a terrible scene. A man in dark armor stands, holding a bloody sword, over the corpse of a traveling merchant. He is inspecting something in his hand. In the corner lies a gigantic turtle shell, with gouges carved in it.

You sneak up on him, with all the quiet you can muster. Then you step on a stone that scratches against another.

"_Hey!_" Corhyn yells, saving you --- he has run around the outside and found a section of collapsed wall. "This is a house of worship! How dare you murder here!" He steps out, knife drawn from belt, and a hidden blade drawn from his cane.

The knight twirls his sword.

You plunge yours into the back of his knee.

He growls in pain, and his sword does something you can barely comprehend. It fliest form his hand, aglow in crimson, and flies directly at you. Parrying knocks you off-balance by the brute force of the blow. The knight stands on his good leg and with a gesture catches the blade again. You dance back and ready a handful of liquid fire.

As you throw, the flying sword swipes you across the chest, ripping through bone, slicing your collarbone, sternum, and ribs in a great spray of blood. Instinctively you conjure fire in your hand and cauterize the wound.

The knight gets doused in slick fire, his brigandine catching flame, but readies a killing blow regardless.

With your last strength you throw your sword and guide the fire inside. His breastplate gives out like white-hot iron under a chisel, and your father's blade burns a path through his heart.

Then you collapse.

Titania gallops for a Grace in unfamiliar lands, seeking desperately a mote of gold, unable to see the guidance of it.

You wake to the taste of healing draught on your lips. Your head rests softly on thighs of someone, and as you open your eyes, you see Melina over you.

"Welcome back, Jester. We almost lost you."

"Melina?" You feel weak and look aside to see Corhyn standing next to a giant grey turtle, wearing an arch priest's headdress. "What happened?"

"You killed the infamous Bell Bearing Hunter and suffered a bane wound. Miriel there held you to life with a healing miracle. I sent Corhyn out on Torrent to find a golden seed and sacred tear. I brewed a restorative, and it has brought you back to life. Where is the one I gave you?"

"Lent it to Titania."

She smiles. "Of course."

"I owe you my life, once more, fair Melina."

"If you die, who will bring me to the Erdtree?"

Your eyelids feel heavy. "I am very tired."

"Then sleep, noble Ezekiel. We will watch over you. Titania will be here shortly."

-----

You wake, feeling drained, to the familiar feeling of Titania's presence.

She sits by your side. You're wrapped in your cloak for warmth and modesty.

"Hey."

"Hey."

"Sorry."

"What for?"

"Not being here to save you."

"No, I'm sorry."

"What?"

"I should never have risked myself without you here."

You reach out --- you wish you could reach her face, but you settle for her hand. She takes yours in both of hers.

"It's good to see you."

She chuckles. "Likewise. Let's never do this again, yeah?" A tear rolls down Titania's cheek. She wipes it away, and sniffles hard. "Sorry. I don't know why I'm suddenly so emotional. You're alive."

"It's okay. We've been apart for two moons."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

She bends down to kiss your forehead. "My lord."

"My knight."

You push yourself up to sit, and feel the Fire Cultist robe fall apart around your chest. You see Melina by the Grace --- she seems ill at ease, and flecks of ash seems to drift about her. Corhyn sits with a fire going, inexpertly cooking slices of meat on your skillet. With some struggle, you get up to stand, and Titania supports you.

"Melina, you should go --- staying here so long is taxing on you, is it not?"

"Do y---you not have runes?" She looks to you, smiling.

You do. A vast bounty. "Two thirds."

She takes your hand, and you feel strength return in a _major_ way.

"Jester," she says and evaporates.

You sit by the grace, feeling relief wash over you, and lay your restorative flask by the honeyed golden radiance. Corhyn offers you the pan, and you skewer a sliver of meat, blowing on it to cool the hot, slightly charred flesh. Titania comes over with your old clothes from Torrent's saddlebags --- in marginally better condition. You really need to find a tailor or an armorer. Or perhaps steal something from the Hold.

"Pardon me."

Behind you, the great turtle Miriel has somehow snuck close. 

"I couldn't help but notice the bond you have with that maiden."

"Melina is a friend."

"I surmise, but... forgive an old romantic. This is the Church of Vows. I am Miriel, Pastor of Vows, steward of these sacred chambers."

You look up at the lack of roof, but say nothing.

"It is here, in this very holy ground, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. And so my church held in view the monuments of both houses. The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Here I officiated the union of Radagon of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala of House Caria. I can tell you much more if you wish, but I am therefore cognizant of love when I see it."

You look into the fire, rather than the Grace. Of course you find Melina near breathtakingly beautiful, no wonder that you'd fall for her. "Wait, are you saying Melina---?"

"Maid Melina most certainly feels deep fondness for you," Miriel says sagely. "She sat by you the whole time, stroking your forehead and muttering prayers for you."

"He's right," Titania says, coming over to you with an armful of looted possessions from the dead knight. The dead merchant's stock, she has left well enough alone. "I spoke to her a few times. She likes you. A lot. That's why she stayed so long, even if it pained her --- she's not long for this world when she shows herself. She wanted to see you wake."

"Extraordinary," Corhyn says. "To think Melina of all people... I suppose the sheer number of Tarnished she must have helped over the ages, it was bound to happen."

You feel an odd lightness.

-----

Corhyn performs burial rites for the merchant. Miriel ordains the service. His stock of wares you leave in the church of vows, should another wanderer come by to claim his brother's.

The fell knight, you cremate. No burial for a murderer. His sword, armor and shield, you bring with you, and step through Grace into the Roundtable Hold.

Titania follows you to the southeast wing, Hewg's forge. She looks about, almost disinterested, and almost demonstratively looks away as Hewg himself comes over.

"Well, where have you been hiding? I took you for dead."

"Near thing," you say.

"No matter. Lay out your arms."

You put the dark knight's sword on his anvil. "The man who wielded this blade could make it fly through the air according to his will."

Hewg draws it. "Inelegant blade. Strong magick inlaid in the blade, it'll dance to its wielder's will."

"So it's the blade, not the man."

"Aye."

You unsling your father's sword. "Can you transfer that magic to my sword?"

Hewg draws your blade, and lines the two up, eyeing something. "Maybe. Interesting challenge. Give me six bells."

"Hey, uh," Titania says. "Hewg, was it?"

"Yeah?"

"Do you need some help with your barnacle infection?" she gestures to her face. "Also, I think I could get you some... clothes. Maybe a leather apron."

"Why?"

"Because like... it bothers me. I know what it's like to have barnacles, I had them when I was a girl."

"I'm used to it."

"Fucking hell, old man, just say yes, will you? Have a young woman take a little care of you? Why are you refusing?"

"It's a bother. I used to have clothes, but they never last more than a few thousand days anyway."

Titania comes up to him. "Listen, I'm gonna take a trip home for some tools, and then you're having those barnacles removed, if I have to hold you down while I do it. And trust me, I _can._"

"I suppose it can't hurt. Whatever. Just don't disturb me while I work. This will be a delicate task."

-----

Returning to Morning has Titania spend a few hours yelling at her staff and government officials --- it's the first time she's been back in over two weeks, and so some affairs are egregiously out of order. You dread to think what it would have been like if she had stayed absent for the entire duration of your time apart.

You want nothing more than to call on Melina and talk to her about whatever feelings she might have, and you as well, but she very probably needs her rest.

Instead you take it on yourself to wander the city, and a gaggle of street kids take to following you. You take to conjuring little clouds of sparks and smoke, and making little things of flame dance between your fingers. Your audience is delighted. One of them asks you to juggle, but you have nothing with which to juggle.

Night falls and you return to Castle Morne, finding Titania in a meeting with some human messengers and some nicely-dressed chimera. You leave her to her business and head back to the church.

"Melina."

There's a long moment before she appears.

"Ezekiel."

You regard her for a long moment, then you undo your headwrap and veil, showing her your face. "I thought you deserved to see my face by now, life debt and all."

"What is this about?"

"Where I come from, showing one's face is improper, save to close friends, family... lovers."

"Lovers?"

"I... I spoke to Miriel --- the turtle priest --- and Titania. About you."

She regards you for a long moment. "You are not just a little haughty to insinuate such things?"

"Pardon?"

"You didn't call upon me for _two moons,_ Ezekiel! That is no way to treat your Maiden."

"I was---" you stop yourself. There's not really an excuse for why you wouldn't have been able to ride off to find a Grace once in a while. "Yeah, no. You're right. I was much too focused on amassing power, so I can become Elden Lord."

She sighs and hugs herself. "I know. I was the one who spurred you onto this quest with our accord. It is not my place to judge what you deem necessary to sit the throne and rule the mountains of man. But..."

Looking at you, you almost see a tear in her eye.

"I was not pleased when the first time I saw you in two moons, was to be called upon to save your life and sit by while your chest was cut open. It was... difficult for me."

You take this moment to step closer to her. "I do truly owe you two life debts. Maybe more. I do not know how to repay you --- honoring our accord will be dreadfully insufficient."

She looks away and shakes her head.

"Looking back, I have missed quite terribly. I was busying myself to forget that people I love and treasure were missing from my life. Titania, of course, but also you."

You hold out your hand, and she lets you take hers. "I can promise you one thing: it'll never happen again. Even if I have to travel a land where there is no Grace to summon you by, I will find a way to bring you with me somehow."

"I think that cannot be done; you also said you would find a way for me to have a body anew. These are impossibilities. I both appreciate the sentiment and resent the lofty promises you will never be able to---"

"I am Empyrean. I've been killed once, and mortally wounded three times already. I've mastered pyromancy to the degree of the greatest flamecallers in moons, where it takes them hundreds. I have done the impossible, and I will do it again. I have been---" you stop yourself. "Sorry. I am boasting."

"This is exactly my point. So far, they are but boasts. I've heard Tarnished claim such before, infatuated with me. My heart has grown calloused to it."

You close your eyes. It's true. You have done none of these things, but Titania's optimism is infectious. "Okay. No promises. But I am going to try."

"Of course you are."

"No. Not of course. I will try because it is a travesty that you're here, burned and bodiless, with naught in life but a nebulous search for purpose. You deserve better, and I find myself in a position to try to provide that!" You're getting agitated, but find no way in your mind to steady yourself.

"You're very kind, but you only do these things because I'm beautiful."

"You've a very low view of yourself to think you only deserve kindness owing to your beauty!"

She looks away but at the same time, takes your other hand.

"I'll love you if you'll let me. Not as some maiden to guide and strengthen me, but as a woman. And if not I swear to be your loyal friend. In either case I will face death for you, overcome any trial needed."

"Do you really mean that?"

"One cannot be a jester if one does not occasionally speak deep truths."

"One can also say too much."

You bite your tongue.

"Ezekiel... you're kind, and you're beautiful, and you hold promise --- so much promise." She sighs. "I guard myself to keep sane. I've been at this for countless, countless moons. I scarcely remember... and each time I've my heart broken, it gets a little harder."

"But?"

She sighs. "I hate that I cannot help falling in love with the ones like you."

Your heart flutters a little. "I won't promise that this will be the last time, but..."

She sheds a tear. "Here's to hoping. I... I haven't had that in a long time. Hope."

You feel now is the time to raise her hand to your lips. "I am happy to provide."

"Gods, Ezekiel," she smiles, and wipes her eyes. "What am I going to do with you?"

You shrug. "Kiss me?"

She stands on her toes to do so.

Her lips feel chalky with ash but you care not.
