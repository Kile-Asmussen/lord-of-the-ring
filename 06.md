# Maidens

You reach your destination in the lush mesas of eastern Liurnia. To the west lies the vast swamps and the city of Luke built on the islands of rock and even into the swamplands themselves, under the watchful eye of the sorcerer-governors of Raya Lucaria, where sits the ruler of Liurnia, the immortal Carian Queen Rennala.

But you are here for the Cultists of Flame, who live in a village on the edge of a rock shelf, from where the ocean is visible in the far distance.

A strong man in red robes approaches you, wielding a mace. "Halt. For what purpose do you come here?"

Corhyn steps forward. "We come in peace. I am Brother Corhyn a man of the cloth; this here is my disciple, Jester. She wishes to learn the way of the flame. I have taught her but what little I know."

The guardsman looks to you. You hold out a hand and conjure a fuel-less flame above your palm.

"We do not take inductions without introduction."

You know he will refuse you thrice. "I may be Tarnished, but you will find me a capable student."

"Your flame is weak."

"One adds fuel and air to weak flames to make them strong."

"We preach heresy, the holyman wishes to see you branded."

"I trust him, he is a good man."

The guard looks you up and down. "Come with, Jester. I will see you to the clothier --- blue is not our color. Brother Corhyn, you may stay as a guest if you can earn your keep."

"I know a healing miracle, I am literate, and I am no stranger to doing work, so long as it is not overly objectionable."

Through grace, to the swamps. Revenants lurk there.

Dee joins Titania, with two other knights of Gurranq.

A great grotesque being of too many arms, spitting poison and fast like an ill wind.

By a gesture and a prayer, she rips stones from a ruin sunk into the mud, throwing them with thunderous force. Her clawed gauntlet rends flesh with blades of wind.

Dee summons holy light, the other knights wield flame and a great hammer. A fierce and terrible hunt.

They winnow the deathroot and burn the stump in cleansing fire.

Melina comes as called, trading runes for strength in Titania. They talk for a spell, but you cannot hear what about.

Gurranq accepts the offering, devouring the foul plant.

-----

You spend many days in meditation, many days conjuring fire, felling trees and cutting lumber, working the charcoal kilns, and participating in the ritual of emberwalking. You sit disciple to the great pyromancers, learning to turn flame to liquid, to force, and even to cleansing and purification and healing warmth. You learn to extinguish a bonfire with a gesture, and ignite one at twenty paces with a snap of your fingers.

The old crone flame reader calls you a 'kindler' and a 'keeper of fire.' You practice with the heat of dragons which Hewg put inside your father's sword. The fire helps your preparations, hastening the extractions of useful essences from herbs and animals. Intimacy with heat also makes you better at cooking meals, somehow.

Corhyn tells stories to the children, tills the fields, and heals the injured.

At the end of two moons, you feel much strengthened --- though not through runes --- prepared to return, and you miss your Shadow quite terribly. Out there you feel Titania must have the same instinct.

You bid a very fond farewell to your new friends, and you and Corhyn head onto the road once more.

"We could travel straight to the Roundtable Hold."

"There's a church I wish to visit, a little north of here."

So you set out on another day's travel, through fair Liurnia, seeing wolfpacks on the prowl and great natural stone pillars toppled.

By night, atop a twisting path, lies another ruin. "Why are all the churches in ruin?"

"There was a war," he says, and unhelpfully elaborates: "No reason to rebuild them. They feel almost holier this way."

Inside is no holy place. You feel the animosity, the killing intent, before even entering, drawing your sword.

There you find a terrible scene. A man in dark armor stands, holding a bloody sword, over the corpse of a traveling merchant. He is inspecting something in his hand. In the corner lies a gigantic turtle shell, with gouges carved in it.

You sneak up on him, with all the quiet you can muster. Then you step on a stone that scratches against another.

"_Hey!_" Corhyn yells, saving you --- he has run around the outside and found a section of collapsed wall. "This is a house of worship! How dare you murder here!" He steps out, knife drawn from belt, and a hidden blade drawn from his cane.

The knight twirls his sword.

You plunge yours into the back of his knee.

He growls in pain, and his sword does something you can barely comprehend. It flies form his hand, aglow in crimson, and comes directly at you. Parrying knocks you off-balance by the brute force of the blow. The knight stands on his good leg and with a gesture catches the blade again. You dance back and ready a handful of liquid fire.

As you throw, the flying sword swipes you across the chest, ripping through bone, slicing your collarbone, sternum, and ribs in a great spray of blood. Instinctively you conjure fire in your hand and cauterize the wound.

The knight gets doused in slick fire, his brigandine catching flame, but readies a killing blow regardless.

With your last strength you throw your sword and guide the fire inside. His breastplate gives out like white-hot iron under a chisel, and your father's blade burns a path through his heart.

Then you collapse.

Titania gallops for a Grace in unfamiliar lands, seeking desperately a mote of gold, unable to see the guidance of it.

```

-----

You wake to the taste of healing draught on your lips. Your head rests softly on thighs of someone, and as you open your eyes, you see Melina over you.

"Welcome back, Jester. We almost lost you."

"Melina?" You feel weak and look aside to see Corhyn standing next to a giant grey turtle, wearing an arch priest's headdress. "What happened?"

"You killed one of the infamous Bell Bearing Hunters and suffered a bane wound. Miriel there held you to life with a healing miracle. I sent Corhyn out on Torrent to find a golden seed and sacred tear. I brewed a restorative, and it has brought you back to life. Where is the one I gave you?"

"Lent it to Titania."

She smiles. "Of course."

"I owe you my life, once more, fair Melina."

"If you die, who will bring me to the Erdtree?"

Your eyelids feel heavy. "I am very tired."

"Then sleep, noble Ezekiel. We will watch over you. Titania will be here shortly."

-----

You wake, feeling drained, to the familiar feeling of Titania's presence.

She sits by your side. You're wrapped in your cloak for warmth and modesty.

"Hey."

"Hey."

"Sorry."

"What for?"

"Not being here to save you."

"No, I'm sorry."

"What?"

"I should never have risked myself without you here."

You reach out --- you wish you could reach her face, but you settle for her hand. She takes yours in both of hers.

"It's good to see you."

She chuckles. "Likewise. Let's never do this again, yeah?" A tear rolls down Titania's cheek. She wipes it away, and sniffles hard. "Sorry. I don't know why I'm suddenly so emotional. You're alive."

"It's okay. We've been apart for two moons."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

She bends down to kiss your forehead. "My lord."

"My knight."

You push yourself up to sit, and feel the Fire Cultist robe fall apart around your chest. You see Melina by the Grace --- she seems ill at ease, and flecks of ash seems to drift about her. Corhyn sits with a fire going, inexpertly cooking slices of meat on your skillet. With some struggle, you get up to stand, and Titania supports you.

"Melina, you should go --- staying here so long is taxing on you, is it not?"

"Do y---you not have runes?" She looks to you, smiling.

You do. A vast bounty. "Two thirds."

She takes your hand, and you feel strength return in a _major_ way.

"Jester," she says and evaporates.

You sit by the Grace, feeling relief wash over you, and lay your restorative flask by the honeyed golden radiance. Corhyn offers you the pan, and you skewer a sliver of meat, blowing on it to cool the hot, slightly charred flesh. Titania comes over with your old clothes from Torrent's saddlebags --- in marginally better condition. You really need to find a tailor or an armorer. Or perhaps steal something from the Hold.

"Pardon me."

Behind you, the great turtle Miriel has somehow snuck close. 

"I could not help but notice the bond you have with that maiden."

"Melina is a friend."

"I surmise, but... forgive an old romantic. This is the Church of Vows. I am Miriel, Pastor of Vows, steward of these sacred chambers."

You look up at the lack of roof, but say nothing.

"It is here, in this very holy ground, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined. And so my church held in view the monuments of both houses. The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Here I officiated the union of Radagon of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala of House Caria. I can tell you much more if you wish, but I am therefore cognizant of love when I see it."

You look into the fire, rather than the Grace. Of course you find Melina near breathtakingly beautiful, no wonder that you'd fall for her. "Wait, are you saying Melina---?"

"Maid Melina most certainly feels deep fondness for you," Miriel says sagely. "She sat by you the whole time, stroking your forehead and muttering prayers for you."

"He's right," Titania says, coming over to you with an armful of looted possessions from the dead knight. The dead merchant's stock, she has left well enough alone. "I spoke to her a few times. She likes you. A lot. That's why she stayed so long, even if it pained her --- she's not long for this world when she shows herself. She wanted to see you wake."

"Extraordinary," Corhyn says. "To think Melina of all people... I suppose the sheer number of Tarnished she must have helped over the ages, it was bound to happen."

You feel an odd lightness.

-----

Corhyn performs burial rites for the merchant. Miriel ordains the service. His stock of wares you leave in the Church of Vows, should another wandering merchant come by to claim his brother's.

The fell knight, you cremate. No burial for a murderer. His sword, armor and shield, you bring with you, and step through Grace into the Roundtable Hold.

Titania follows you to the southeast wing, Hewg's forge. She looks about, almost disinterested, and almost demonstratively looks away as Hewg himself comes over.

"Well, where have you been hiding? I took you for dead."

"Near thing," you say.

"No matter. Lay out your arms."

You put the dark knight's sword on his anvil. "The man who wielded this blade could make it fly through the air according to his will."

Hewg draws it. "Inelegant blade. Strong magick inlaid, it'll dance to its wielder's will."

"So it's the blade, not the man."

"Aye."

You unsling your father's sword. "Can you transfer that magic to my sword?"

Hewg draws your blade, and lines the two up, eyeing something. "Maybe. Interesting challenge. Give me six bells."

"Hey, uh," Titania says. "Hewg, was it?"

"Yeah?"

"Do you need some help with your barnacle infection?" she gestures to her face. "Also, I think I could get you some... clothes. Maybe a leather apron."

"Why?"

"Because like... it bothers me. I know what it's like to have barnacles, I had them when I was a girl."

"I'm used to it."

"Fucking hell, old man, just say yes, will you? Have a young woman take a little care of you? Why are you refusing?"

"It's a bother. I used to have clothes, but they never last more than a few thousand days anyway."

Titania comes up to him. "Listen, I'm gonna take a trip home for some tools, and then you're having those barnacles removed, if I have to hold you down while I do it. And trust me, I _can._"

"I suppose it can't hurt. Whatever. Just don't disturb me while I work. This will be a delicate task."

-----

Returning to Morning has Titania spend a few hours yelling at her staff and government officials --- it's the first time she's been back in over two weeks, and so some affairs are egregiously out of order. You dread to think what it would have been like if she had stayed absent for the entire duration of your time apart.

You want nothing more than to call on Melina and talk to her about whatever feelings she might have, and you as well, but she very probably needs her rest.

Instead you take it on yourself to wander the city, and a gaggle of street kids take to following you. You start conjuring little clouds of sparks and smoke, and making little things of flame dance between your fingers. Your audience is delighted. One of them asks you to juggle, but you have nothing with which to do so.

Night falls and you return to Castle Morne, finding Titania in a meeting with some human messengers and some nicely-dressed chimera. You leave her to her business and head back to the church.

"Melina."

There's a long moment before she appears.

"Ezekiel."

You regard her for a long moment, then you undo your headwrap and veil, showing her your face. "I thought you deserved to see my face by now, life debt and all."

"What is this about?"

"Where I come from, showing one's face is improper, save to close friends, family... lovers."

"Lovers?"

"I... I spoke to Miriel --- the turtle priest --- and Titania. About you."

She regards you for a long moment. "You are not just a little haughty to insinuate such things?"

"Pardon?"

"You didn't call upon me for _two moons,_ Ezekiel! That is no way to treat your Maiden."

"I was---" you stop yourself. There's not really an excuse for why you wouldn't have been able to ride off to find a Grace once in a while. "Yeah, no. You're right. I was much too focused on amassing power, so I can become Elden Lord."

She sighs and hugs herself. "I know. I was the one who spurred you onto this quest with our accord. It is not my place to judge what you deem necessary to sit the throne and rule the mountains of man. But..."

Looking at you, you almost see a tear in her eye.

"I was not pleased when the first time I saw you in two moons, was to be called upon to save your life and sit by while your chest was cut open. It was... difficult for me."

You take this moment to step closer to her. "I do truly owe you two life debts. Maybe more. I do not know how to repay you --- honoring our accord will be dreadfully insufficient."

She looks away and shakes her head.

"Looking back, I have missed you quite terribly. I was busying myself to forget that people I love and treasure were missing from my life. Titania, of course, but also you."

You hold out your hand, and she lets you take hers. "I can promise you one thing: it'll never happen again. Even if I have to travel a land where there is no Grace to summon you by, I will find a way to bring you with me somehow."

"I think that cannot be done; you also said you would find a way for me to have a body anew. These are impossibilities. I both appreciate the sentiment and resent the lofty promises you will never be able to---"

"I am Empyrean. I've been killed once, and mortally wounded three times already. I've mastered pyromancy to the degree of the greatest flamecallers in moons, where it takes them hundreds. I have done the impossible, and I will do it again. I have been---" you stop yourself. "Sorry. I am boasting."

"This is exactly my point. So far, they are but boasts. I've heard Tarnished claim such before, infatuated with me. My heart has grown calloused to it."

You close your eyes. It's true. You have done none of these things, but Titania's optimism is infectious. "Okay. No promises. But I am going to try."

"Of course you are."

"No. Not of course. I will try because it is a travesty that you're here, burned and bodiless, with naught in life but a nebulous search for purpose. You deserve better, and I find myself in a position to try to provide that!" You're getting agitated, but find no way in your mind to steady yourself.

"You're very kind, but you only do these things because I'm beautiful."

"You've a very low view of yourself to think you only deserve kindness owing to your beauty!"

She looks away but at the same time, takes your other hand.

"I'll love you if you'll let me. Not as some Maiden to guide and strengthen me, but as a woman. And if not, I swear to be your loyal friend. In either case I will face death for you, overcome any trial needed."

"Do you really mean that?"

"One cannot be a jester if one does not occasionally speak deep truths."

"One can also say too much."

You bite your tongue.

"Ezekiel... you're kind, and you're beautiful, and you hold promise --- so much promise." She sighs. "I guard myself to keep sane. I've been at this for countless, countless moons. I scarcely remember... and each time I've my heart broken, it gets a little harder."

"But?"

She sighs. "I hate that I cannot help falling in love with the ones like you."

Your heart flutters a little. "I won't promise that this will be the last time, but..."

She sheds a tear. "Here's to hoping. I... I haven't had that in a long time. Hope."

You feel now is the time to raise her hand to your lips. "I am happy to provide."

"Gods, Ezekiel," she smiles, and wipes her eyes. "What am I going to do with you?"

You shrug. "Kiss me?"

She stands on her toes to do so.

Her lips feel chalky with ash but you care not. You put your hands on her hips under her cloak, she takes your face in her palms. You kiss her again, and again, she bites your lip, you push her against the wall, and lift her by the rump; she puts her legs around your hips.

"_Ezekiel,_" she breathes.

"_Melina,_" you mutter into her neck.

She cannot stay long, even as you now fervently wish she could.

----

Titania takes one look at you and says nothing, just smiles knowingly.

For very obvious reasons Melina does not go to the Roundtable Hold these days --- everyone there is someone she has helped or at the very least invited there. Her appearance would rouse some or all the despondent Tarnished there. There might be a riot.

Hewg has your sword ready.

"This was a stubborn thing," Hewg says, holding the blackened executioner sword. "Vile blade. Had your blood on it, ma'am."

"Yeah." You draw your father's sword, but even as you go to pull it, the thing slides from the scabbard on its own accord. You refrain from grasping the hilt, gripping empty air and kind of just gesturing. The blade slides out and flips over in the air with ease.

"Take care with that thing," Titania says behind you.

"She won't injure naught but herself, this is the Hold," Hewg says. "It likes you, your sword."

"It was my father's. I treasure it."

"Good. Keep doing that."

No longer it seems will you have to take the sword from your back to draw it from the scabbard.

"Thank you, Master Hewg," you say. "If I am after armor, what do you have?"

"First check the textile rooms o'er in the the residence. Whenever miss Fia selects a victim, their clothing gets added to the piles. If you find anything you fancy, I can certainly fit it to your shape."

Titania stays with him, and you hear her say: "_Let's take a look at those barnacles, old man._"

You head back up to the Roundtable, and around to the southwest, up the stairs to the upper level and the larger of the textile rooms. There lies an absolute mountain of clothing and articles of armor, and you begin rooting through it trying ot find something that'll fit you. Preferably something with a breastplate --- you still feel pangs of pain across your sternum.

Something red wouldn't be out of place either. Light blue is fine, but your fire monk robes had a certain charm.

"Greetings, great champion. Jester."

You stand and spin --- the only reason you do not let your sword leap out of its scabbard is you know the sanctuary makes it meaningless.

There stands a woman with sickly-pale skin dressed in dark, lose robes.

"Fia."

"You know who I am."

"I've heard the rumors. Seen the pile of corpses."

She smiles. "Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold."

"And somehow you circumvent the sanctuary," you say.

"You allege misconduct. I take no offense. The Tarnished I take to my chambers come willingly. They have nothing left; it is a mercy."

"Aha."

Fia enters and closes the door behind her. "Permit me to explain myself. I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. I lay with and received the warmth and life force of several champions; then with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life --- a rebirth."

"I'll refrain from making judgments, but that sounds... revolting. You took the lives of people to consummate with a _corpse?_"

"Nothing so literal. It is a sacred ritual, more than a base act of the flesh. But as I carried this noble to new life, I was called by Grace and driven into exile."

You nod. You remember being called by Grace, and your own mother turning away from you.

"Pray, be kind. Despite it all, I still wish to be Deathbed Companion."

"Good luck with that."

"Jester, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly? Perhaps you might share with me some of your warmth, vigor and stout-heartedness?"

"_I_ will hold you if _you_ need to be held --- it sounds like you have not felt the embrace of a caring soul in some time; it sounds like you've led a rough life, and not known many peers... But I need my life force, thanks. I have plans with it. Also I have a girlfriend already."

"Oh. Well... it would be rude of me to spurn your kindness."

She comes up to you, arms outstretched, and as you look upon her up close you see the pain laid as lines in her delicate porcelain skin. Your judgment of her seems quite right.

You put your arms around her, and she put hers on your back. Your chin lays on her crown, thus is the height different between you.

"_Jester,_" she whispers.

"Yes?"

"_You're--- burning--- me..._"

You let go and she falls away from you, collapsing on the floor and lying there for but a moment before crying out in pain. The skin on her arms, where her robe has fallen away, is red and inflamed.

Nothing makes sense, but you know to help, crouching down by her side. She recoils from your touch: "_Get away!_"

Fia scrambles away and up against the wall.

"Thousand pardons, madam Fia," you say. "What went wrong?"

"What _are_ you?" she snarls.

"Myself. I'm an initiate of the ways of fire --- is that it?"

She shakes her head. "I've had pyromancers of greater acumen than yours before. Jester, you are something _else._ Something _sinister._"

The door slams open, and a very annoyed Titania stands there.

"I was in the middle of something," she says, brandishing some kind of specialized knife.

"Yeah. Madam Fia needs help to get back to bed," you say.

Titania comes over and offers a hand to Fia. She swats it away and struggles up to stand under her own power, and staggers out of the room.

"I'll get back to Hewg."

"Go."

You return to looking through the discarded armors and garments. You pick out a cuirass that mostly fits, pauldrons and vambraces, faulds and tassets, greaves and sabatons. A strong arming doublet and chausses to go under it. For your head, a simple helm with a prominent nose guard a leather cap. The metal is all painted in mostly the same colors, too.

Completing the outfit you take a great red pelt to tie around your waist with a heavy belt.

You bring it to Hewg for adjustments.

----

You find a little respite in the banquet hall. It is dirty and unfurnished, but you sense there can be some potential here. Gideon Ofnir has his library, Fia the residence, Hewg the forge... perhaps you could recruit some kitchen help, and style yourself the _chef_ of the roundtable.

Titania shares a meal with you of dried meats, hardtack, and bitter wine. You sit on the table. She has long ago acquired good, well-fitted armor --- Gurranq employs many beings of strange bodies, and his armorers account for that --- and her Bloodhound Knight armaments have no need of replacement or improvement.

"I got you a little something over in Caelid, actually."

"Caelid?"

"It's the... I guess once it was a kingdom, now it's... not. Out east. The whole land is... sick. There's a few towns there where they burn away the creeping growth, there's lakes of poison..."

"Why does Gurranq have his castle there?"

"He was there first. Anyway, I stole this from a knight order --- the Redmanes. They used to serve one of the demigods, General Radahn."

"Never heard of him."

She hands you a little jar, and you open it, revealing ash.

"What does it do?"

"Something with fire. I couldn't figure it out myself --- it's not like the others I use."

"The others?"

She pats her left arm with her right. "Here, I've got the endurance to stop a charging ox."

She taps her right arm. "This one, the determination to land a killing blow."

Tapping her knee she continues: "I can stomp to shake the earth ---" she taps the other "--- or to call a force that draws fleeing foes back to me --- stole that one from the Redmanes too."

Last she beats her chest, "and then my roar strikes fear in my enemies."

You look into the jar. "And you also learned miracles, did you not?"

"A few. I've learned about wind and stone, got in touch with my inner beast, learned to heal, some. I also got a lot of time to get good at regular fighting, and a _lot_ of runes. Hunting the living dead is profitable."

"I feel like I'm falling behind you."

"Isn't that the point? I'm your Shadow. I'm supposed to be the scary one."

You rest your head on her shoulder and take a sip of your wine. She leans over to kiss your head and bury her nose in your loose hair.

Nepheli of all people come to seek you out.

"To what do we owe the pleasure, madam Loux?" you ask, hopping off the table. You take a third earthenware cup. "Wine?"

"Thank you but no thank you... Jester, and---" she points to Titania.

"Nameless."

"Jester and Nameless. The situation in castle Stormveil is worsening. King Godrick has been mad for an age, and it is coming to a crescendo: he has been rounding up Tarnished and dissidents to his rule and grafting them into abominations for a long time, but has now started capturing his own innocent subjects from Stormburg. His depraved cult of belligerent chirurgeons and blood alchemists are some of the worst people you will ever meet, and they are building him an army of grotesque abominations. He needs to be stopped."

"Okay. He's got a Great Rune. I need that." You hop off the table. "Let me just get my armor from Hewg."

"Hang on, how do you know that?" Titania asks.

"My father has many spies. He does not only learn from books."

"And who is he sending besides you?" Titania presses.

"If not you, I shall be joining with a sorcerer named Rogiérre."

Titania stands up, and looms over her. "Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's the city of Stormburg and its _army,_ and Stormveil's _fortifications_ between you and King Godrick. And you're planning to go there with _one_ sorcerer?"

"You do not bring an army to assassinate a king. And no, my first option was you two: the prodigal pyromancer Empyrean and her Shadow knight, the Lord of Morne and favored apprentice of Gurranq."

She smiles mischievously.

You walk up to her and put a hand on her shoulder in passing. "A pretty thing like you can certainly tag along."

Down in the forge, Hewg has done stellar work as always. He wears a strong leather apron, a black shirt with sleeves rolled up, his patchy beard has been trimmed, and the nasty barnacles on his scalp have been removed.

"Adjustments according to your measurements, ma'am."

The whole set of armor is wrapped in a cloth bundle. He has even touched up the paint where it was scuffed.

"How was the makeover?"

He scratches his head. "Good, good."

"Glad to hear."

With your armor in hand, and grabbing a black shield clad in leather from the armory, you head to the kitchens to get changed. Titania has cleared out the few despondents who had taken refuge there, and is waiting for you. Part of your heart aches for those lost souls.

"You flustered that poor woman something awful."

"Really? I heard from Corhyn she did not have eyes for women."

Titania comes over to help you with some of the straps. "Yeah, well, either he was wrong, or madam Loux only just found out today." She takes the jar of ash and smears its contents across your cheeks and nose. "Ditch the veil."

"What--- I can't just---"

"Yes you can, love. If you're going to be Elden Lord, your subjects need to see your face. You can't be a monarch and wear a veil."

You hold the fabric and string in your hand, looking at it --- your modesty has always felt like it depended on you keeping secrets. Your face, your name. "Let's keep the cover-names, though it seems people have no trouble finding out what we're really called."

"Yes, my lord."

Armored and decked in red wolfpelt, though feeling quite exposed, with magic sword on your back and fire in your heart, you head to the table where Nepheli is waiting. She has donned some armor herself, over her embroidered doublet.

"Lead the way."
