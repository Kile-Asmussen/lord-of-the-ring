# Communion

Boc sits on Squall, holding his mouth, trying not to be sick for a good while of the day. None of you are keen to wait for another rune bear to come claim the dead one's hunting grounds. You push Torrent and Squall to trot the whole way, covering leagues of distance to the edge of the woods.

"You want to be strong," you say to Boc.

He nods.

"Titania, did you get the runes for the bear?"

"Aye."

"Give them to Boc. We'll find a Grace and summon Melina."

Titania hands Boc a veritable fortune in runes, and Boc sits with the big ball of gold for a moment.

"Crush it," you say and mime closing your hand.

He does with both hands.

-----

At the edge of the forest just before nightfall, you find another Grace by the roadside behind a lone tree. You wonder if one day you'll be familiar enough with Limgrave to know your way around by the landmarks and the glow of the Erdtree alone.

Torrent and squall wander off, grazing on nearby bushes of rowa, and you call on her.

"Melina."

She appears promptly, barely two steps from you.

"Ezekiel.

At her appearance, at seeing her loveliness in the light of dusk, you realize how much you have missed her. How you ache for her closeness and comfort. And the fire in her, you feel too, a yearning from her.

Before the ash has even fallen and drifted away, your arms are around her. This is the reason your plate is in torrent's saddlebag. She takes your head in her hands and put her forehead to yours.

"_Sorry,_" you mutter. _Sorry I haven't called upon you for a week._

"_I forgive you,_" she whispers. _I know you didn't, so I could rest._

Then you meet her warm lips in a soft, long kiss, and caress her face as she does yours. It might be a moment, it might be a dozen, before you finally have the wherewithal to think other thoughts than about your love.

You turn to your party, and Melina rests her head on your chest. "Melina, this here is Boc, my seamster. Boc, meet Melina."

Boc takes off his hat and holds it to his chest, bowing deep. "Charmed, milady."

"A delight to meet you, master Boc," Melina says. "How might I help you three?"

"Boc has a need of your trick," you say.

"Ah."

"Maybe explain to him what that trick is?" Titania snarks.

Melina leaves your embrace and goes to Boc, kneeling down on both knees. "I play the role of Finger Maiden for Ezekiel, as such I can transmute runes into strength. Have you a bounty of runes?"

"I do, milady," he says. "Nam--- Titania slew a rune bear last night and donated me the runes of it."

"A dangerous beast," Melina says. "Let me take your hand for but a moment --- share with me your dreams and aspirations."

She holds out her hand, and Boc takes it. "Well, I don't really know what---"

"You don't need to speak them aloud," Melina says gently with a smile. "Just close your eyes and think."

"Oh."

He does.

"It is done."

Boc looks at his hand. "Doesn't feel much different."

"You had a large bounty of runes," Melina says. "For my services, it always becomes a rounding of the character and body. You will find yourself hardier and more enduring now, physically and mentally stronger. But there are variations: Titania wishes for raw strength and speed, Ezekiel seeks growth in the way of spiritual power and hardiness. You... you have stranger wishes. I suspect you will find yourself quicker and nimbler, at the very least."

"Why thank you very much, milady---"

"Melina is just fine, master Boc."

"Well, milady Melina, stop calling me 'master Boc,' then. And thank you kindly. Should you need a seamster, my services are free of charge for any friend of Ezekiel."

You clear your throat. "We also need to see if you can learn to travel through Grace, Boc," you say.

"What's that, cully?"

"A thing we Tarnished can do --- and Titania, for she is my Shadow. I wonder if you can learn it too. It would be very convenient."

"Can it wait?" Melina asks, turning to you. "I should like to take a stroll with you."

----

You walk with Melina by the arm; she clings to you. Down south along the treeline.

"You're not being hurt by heading so far away from Grace, are you?" you ask.

"Not when I'm with you. I promise. You're my grace."

"We really need to find you some way to more permanently be in the world. I miss you terribly."

"As do I. I'm glad to see you are accumulating allies. Not many Tarnished do."

You fall quiet.

"What is it, my love?"

You shake your head. "Titania nearly died fighting that rune bear. I was very hurt but had to give her my curative. We'll need more of them, going forward. At the very least one for Boc."

"Bring me golden seed and sacred tear, and I shall brew you all the flasks you need." She leans her head against your shoulder. "It's a good thing you lived. Rune bears are terrible beings. Bears are bad enough as-is, but at the very least are mere beasts. Rune bears are touched by draconic power."

"Titania decapitated it and it still had the will to maim her. The head tried to bite Boc."

"Good riddance."

"I found him the next day having eviscerated the beast to eat its heart in the hopes of getting strong. Much better he learn about you and---"

"Oh dear."

"Hm?"

"I do not know if... hm." Melina rubs her delicate chin. "In the olden times --- perhaps even before the Golden Order --- there were those who hunted dragons to consume their hearts and gain their powers. It was a practice that died down during the ages of alliance with dragonkin, but has picked up after the shattering, now that dragons are in decline and degeneracy."

"What?"

"The ancient dragons like of the Saxen bloodline, were mindful and spiritual beings, capable of speech and reason, and turning into humanoid form, too. The dragon prince Fortissax was a dear friend of Godwyn --- rumor was they were occasionally lovers. Even now those that remain are still intelligent. Lanseax was the lover of Vyke."

"The guy who had Torrent?"

"Aye. He had a real Finger Maiden, too. I was merely a guiding spirit to him, not a pretender."

"What happened to him?"

"I do not recall. He spurned me. Anyway, the dragons of today are lesser beings, if more numerous. Minds of cunning beasts, but they have lost their tongues and shapeshifting. There are secret orders who practice the dragon communion to this day."

You walk on a bit. "You're thinking Boc---"

"If the rune bears are dragon-touched, _maybe._"

"What does that entail?"

"I do not fully know."

Ominous. You stop to put your arms around her and kiss her long and slowly, drinking her scent of smoke and softness of her lips.

"I best be going," she says.

"I love you."

"I love you, too."

Then she turns to ash.

-----

Returning to camp, you set up to cook and prepare Boc's grisly dinner, and mutton for you and Titania.

"What happened?" Titania asks you, sensing your apprehension and deliberate silence. She's shirtless, with Boc patching the holes in her gambeson and shirt from where the bear's claws tore into her.

"Boc?"

He looks up from his needlework. "Hm?"

"Melina and I spoke about some things. There... might be consequences to your decision to eat this bear heart."

"Oh. Well... I may have been acting without my full wisdom when I did it."

"You should probably finish what you started." You turn over the sizzling sliver of heart in the pan.

"O---okay... If you think so, cully." He looks in the pan.

"Rune bears are touched by dragons, somehow, so Melina says. Eating the heart of a dragon imparts draconic powers. Whether rune bears are that, she doesn't know. But I don't think there's any backing out."

Boc goes back to sewing.

-----

Another week's travel northwest, you meet a river, and travel south along it in the hopes of finding a bridge or a ford to cross it.

Making camp, You and Titania bathe while Boc wanders off to not intrude on your immodesty. He returns later in the day with fish and a fishing net he knit. It's a good change from the wild game, and you invite Melina to dinner --- she stays but a short while, less than half a bell, but it feels almost like she's real.

A few more days go by with Boc slinging stones into the river --- almost all the way across it, sometimes. He fills a pouch with especially uniform oblong rocks along the stony shores. Titania tries her hand at spear fishing with a forked branch, cutting the stick into jagged barbs on the inside of the fork. With her strength and speed, she does catch, though not as well as Boc.

He all but takes over your entire kit of concoctions and gathering tools, too, leaving you to just cook your meals at eventide and occasionally heat one of his jars of strangeness. In the next city you will have to buy a cauldron for him. Your cooking jar does not see much use, but you do cook the occasional stew in it, and have no desire to see it contaminated.

The crossing you do find is not a ford or a bridge, but a ferry. At a narrow section of the river where the current is strong hangs a thick rope across, tied between great trees on either bank. A boat is tethered to this rope, with a pulley to allow the tether to travel across the rope.

By the bank at the ferry terminal you meet the first soul you've seen in days: a man with an unusually long curved sword at his hip, and a helm that looks like a mad smith decided to imitate a straw hat in metal.

"Well met, Tarnished," he says.

"And to you, ser."

"Mind not, I too am Tarnished. I wish you no harm. I am hunting a vile man --- he fled to the other bank on this very ferry."

"Oh? Well, we're just traveling the land to pass time before a rendezvous in Stormburg in a few moons time."

"That does lie on the other side of Murkwater River, here."

"You familiar with the area, ser?"

"Yura is my name. And yes."

"Jester."

He holds out his hand and you shake it.

"Murkwater runs down to Lake Agheel. There you will find a roost of dragons on the rocky island at the center. Agheel, the brood mother, gives name to both the lake, and laid waste to the settlements about it."

"Terrible."

"Indeed. Stay clear of the lake shores if you value your life."

"We come from down south in Haft, though the Mistwoods."

"Ah, lovely city. I presume your companion is from there?" He gestures to Boc.

"You presume correct, ser Yura. I am Boc the seamster."

Yura takes a long moment to regard Boc.

"Hang on," Titania says, looking across the river. "Is there even a ferryman?"

Yura looks across. "Damn. Where did that fellow scamper off to."

"Cully, I could probably make it across on the rope and bring the ferry back," Boc says.

"Take care," Yura cautions. "Nerijus may lurk on the other side --- he might have slain the poor ferryman. He is a vile blood-cultist who delights in murder."

"Sounds like you might like our help?" Titania rumbles. "We're pretty strong. I'm Nameless, by the way."

"I shan't say no, Nameless. You alone look formidable."

You turn to Boc. "Go, but be careful. If you see anything amiss, come right back and we'll find another crossing."

Boc leaves most of his possessions, keeping only his large knife, pouch of rocks, and sling. He  heads up the small hill on the bank to the tree, and climbs up to the rope, heading across it on all fours with great surety of footing.

"Hm. Your seamster is a strange one."

"He is?" you ask.

"There's a dragon communion cult in these parts. Is he part of it?"

"

The ferryman has neither oar nor rudder, just a mechanism to change the side of the boat which the tether attaches. The current does the rest.
