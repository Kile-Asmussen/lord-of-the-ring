# Era of the Worldtree

The Greater Will starts sending its messengers, the Twos Fingers to the Lands Between.

# Era of the Erdtree

The Greater Will sends the Elden Beast to the Lands Between. It  plants the seed of the Erdtree, and the Erdtree subsumes the Worldtree. By that power, the Elden Beast establishes the Law of Causality and reshapes the old way of the Worldtree into the Law of Regression.

Then the Elden Beast falls dormant, turning into the Elden Ring, which prescriptively encodes these laws of causality and regression, governing everything that happens in the Lands Between.

The Elden Beast was created to travel the cosmos and create order, not to govern the order once created. The various Two Fingers therefore start appointing Empyreans, to take up the Elden Ring and govern the Lands Between, enforcing the Greater Will's wishes in the new world.

## The Age of Iron

The Two Fingers select several Empyreans, who battle for the Elden Ring. Of them, two reach prominence:

- Harita, the Gloam-Eyed Queen, leader of the cult of Godslayers, wielding the red-black flame of annihilation.
- Marika, the Fair-Haired Queen, leader of the Badlands Tribes, wielding ???

In the end, Marika obtained the Elden Ring and established her rule as Queen of the Lands Between. However, as Harita was merely defeated, not dead, she still posed a threat with her red-black flame.

Therefore, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring, at once neutering Harita's flame and introducing the cycle of rebirth to the Lands Between. The Rune of Death, she turned into a blade, and gave it to her Shadow.

She used this protection to wage one final persecution of the Godslayer cult, capturing Harita and putting her to the Black Blade, burning her up with her own red-black flame.

Marika, now completely unopposed, called the new state of the world the Golden Order.

## The Age of Gold

Marika wed Hoarah Loux, and to mirror her Shadow he took the spirit lion Sarosh on his back to control his bloodlust and became Godfrey the first Elden Lord.

By his seed, Marika bore the Omen Twins and because it would be bad PR, threw them into the sewers under Leyndell. She then bore Godwyn and he grew up to be a true heir.

The Golden Order turned on the Giants who had mastery over fire that could unmake the Erdtree --- Marika removed the Famine rune to let her armies march on in the unkind homelands of the Giants.

The Giants were eradicated to a man.

The Golden Order was then attacked by the Dragons, who saw the removal of the Rune of Death and Famine as an upset of the Natural Order --- Marika removed the Pestilence rune to let her armies fight continuously without fear of camp disease.

Godfrey slew Gransax, but Godwyn made peace with the dragons by sparing Placidusax, and creating the order of Dragon Cultists.

Having now eliminated existential threats, Marika turned her eyes on conquest. The lands of Altus were prosperous, but neighboring Liurnia grew wary of her threat.

Marika's powerbase of the warrior tribes would not do to lead this conquest --- they had been instrumental in slaughtering the Giants, but it was her son who had made peace with the dragons and strengthened the Order tenfold. Therefore she exiled all the tribes from the Lands Between, including her own husband.

(Godwyn was, shall we say, slightly miffed that his beloved father was sent away.)

Marika mustered her domestic armies, the forces of Altus and Gelmir, the armies of the Golden order and the dragon cultists, and marched on Liurnia. Among this force was Radagon the Red, a strong warrior who rose to the rank of general over the years of the war, eventually leading the Golden Order into the largest battle that would prove the final one.

In the field, he faced the Queen Rennala of Caria, and fell in love. He ordered a retreat, and sent message to Leyndell that peace might be possible. Marika aquiesced and Radagon was raised to the title of Prince of Gelmir and sued for peace.

Rennala accepted his proposal of marriage (and subsequently fell in love with him, it was quite a happy marriage.)

## The Age of Silver

With Liurnia a part of the Golden Order, Marika devoted herself to theological matters, and let Godwyn take over rulership.

Godwyn married and sired an heir.

Rennala bore Radagon three children, Rykard, Radahn, and Ranni.

To Marika's horror, Ranni was chosen as an Empyrean and given as Shadow the beast child Blaidd. But the girl was young and not yet a threat.

All three children were prodigies of sorcery and found powerful teachers. Radahn took after his father and became a General in the Golden Order, Ranni took after her mother and became the Princess of Caria.
