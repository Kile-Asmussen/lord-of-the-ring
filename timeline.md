# Era of the Greattree

In this era, the Greater Will started sending its messengers, the Two Fingers, to the Lands Between. Finger readers arose to interpret their wiggles.

# Era of the Erdtree

The Greater Will sent the Elden Beast to the Lands Between. It planted the seed of the Erdtree, and the Erdtree subsumed the Greattree. By that power, the Elden Beast established the Law of Causality and reshaped the old way of the Greattree into the Law of Regression.

Then the Elden Beast fell dormant, turning into the Elden Ring, which prescriptively encoded these laws of Causality and Regression, governing everything that happened in the Lands Between.

The Elden Beast was created to travel the cosmos and create order, not to govern the order once created. The various Two Fingers therefore started appointing Empyreans, to take up the Elden Ring and govern the Lands Between, enforcing the Greater Will's wishes in the new world.

## The Age of Iron

The Two Fingers selected several Empyreans, who battled for the Elden Ring. Of them, two reached prominence:

Harita, the Gloam-Eyed Queen, leader of the cult of Godslayers, wielding the red-black flame of annihilation.

Marika, the Fair-Haired Queen, leader of the Badlands Tribes, wielding ???

In the end, Marika obtained the Elden Ring and established her rule as Queen of the Lands Between. However, as Harita was merely defeated, not dead, she still posed a threat with her red-black flame.

Therefore, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring, at once neutering Harita's flame and introducing the cycle of rebirth to the Lands Between. The Rune of Death, she turned into a blade, and gave it to her Shadow.

She used this protection to wage one final persecution of the Godslayer cult, capturing Harita and putting her to the Black Blade, burning her up with her own red-black flame.

Marika, now completely unopposed, called the new state of the world the Golden Order.

## The Age of Gold

Marika wed Hoarah Loux, and to mirror her Shadow he took the spirit lion Sarosh on his back to control his bloodlust and became Godfrey the first Elden Lord.

By his seed, Marika bore the Omen Twins but was revolted that the Crucible had touched her own offspring. She kept their birth secret and sent them into the tunnels under Leyndell, and decreed that all Omen children be shunned.

Morgott desired his mother's love despite it all and grew to understand her decision. He took it upon himself to earn it in any way he could, and remained her servant in the dark. Mogh spurned it and delved deeper underground, not to be seen again for a long time.

Marika then bore Godwyn and he grew up to be a true heir.

The Golden Order turned on the Giants who had mastery over fire that could unmake the Erdtree --- Marika removed the Famine rune to let her armies march on in the unkind homelands of the Giants.

The Giants were eradicated to a man.

The Golden Order was then attacked by the Dragons, who saw the removal of the Rune of Death and Famine as an upset of the Natural Order --- Marika removed the Pestilence rune to let her armies fight continuously without fear of camp disease.

Godfrey slew Gransax, but Godwyn made peace with the dragons by sparing Placidusax, and creating the order of Dragon Cultists.

Having now eliminated existential threats, Marika turned her eyes on conquest. The lands of Altus were prosperous, but neighboring Liurnia grew wary of her threat.

Marika's powerbase of the warrior tribes would not do to lead this conquest --- they had been instrumental in slaughtering the Giants, but it was her son who had made peace with the dragons and strengthened the Order tenfold. Therefore she exiled all the tribes from the Lands Between, including her own husband, divesting them of Grace.

(Godwyn was, shall we say, slightly miffed that his beloved father was sent away.)

Marika mustered her domestic armies, the forces of Altus and Gelmir, the armies of the Golden order and the dragon cultists, and marched on Liurnia. Among this force was Radagon the Red, a strong warrior who rose to the rank of general over the years of the war, eventually leading the Golden Order into the largest battle that would prove the final one.

In the field, he faced the Queen Rennala of Caria, and fell in love. He ordered a retreat, and sent message to Leyndell that peace might be possible.

Marika aquiesced and Radagon was raised to the title of Prince of Gelmir and sued for peace. Rennala accepted his proposal of marriage (and subsequently fell in love with him, it was quite a happy marriage.)

## The Age of Silver

With Liurnia a part of the Golden Order, Marika devoted herself to theological matters, and let Godwyn take over rulership.

Godwyn married and sired an heir.

Rennala bore Radagon three children, Rykard, Radahn, and Ranni.

All three children were prodigies of sorcery and found powerful teachers. Radahn took after his father and became a General in the Golden Order, Ranni took after her mother and became the Princess of Caria. Rykard skirted blasphemy and revied the study of fire, founding the Fire Monks.

To Marika's horror, Ranni was chosen as an Empyrean and given as Shadow the beast child Blaidd.

But the girl was young and not yet a threat, and Marika intended to keep her that way. The Carians drived their power from the stars and the fates they encoded --- a system beyond the reach of the Elden Ring.

Marika called Radagon back to Leyendel, and upon seeing his majesty, fell in love with him and seduced him. 

Unbeknownst to everyone, they were but the masculine and feminine aspect of the same being. Radagon was a projection of Marika's self, a counterbalance created by Marika delving into the Law of Causality and neglecting the Law of Regression.

Radagon, wracked with guilt over his infidelity, divorced Rennala, and the peace with Liurnia was broken, but so was its Queen.

Radagon married Marika, becoming the Second Elden Lord.

To honor her new husband, Marika raised his eldest son Rykard to Prince of Gelmir, where his mastery of fire suited well the volcanoes.

Radahn also followed his father. He had grown all-surpassingly powerful, a rival to Godwyn in sheer strength. The two grew close as brothers, and Marika adopted him as her own son.

Ranni remained. With her mother's heart broken, she took over de-facto rulership of Liurnia, but the Golden Order was by then so powerful that going to war would be suicide. She bore a grudge against her father and his new lover and refused Marika's overtures and offers.

Marika now saw her opportunity to sabotage Ranni and commanded her adoptive son Radahn to use his mastery of Gravitational magic to halt the Firmament.

This cemented Ranni's resentment of Marika into a sworn enmity. Even Godwyn's good will and genuine desire to befriend her did not sway he hatred. A hatred which came to include not only her father, Queen Marika, and her brothers, but also the Two Fingers, and the Greater Will they served.

The only part of her family she still loved was her mother dearest, her Shadow, and her fathers pet red wolf.

## The Age of Pewter

Marika bore Radagon twins, but because of the incestuous nature of the union and Marika's numerous crimes and imbalances, their children were born vulnerable by the caprices of fate and the balance of the Elden Ring.

By the absence of the Rune of Famine, Miquella was cursed with eternal childhood, to never grow to be a proud king like his eldest brother.

By the absence of the Rune of Pestilence, Malenia was cursed with the Scarlet Rot, to waste away and spread horrific deformity wherever she went. (The Greater Will might have allowed this to happen.)

Seeing her offspring once more be afflicted twins, Marika despaired. Radagon did not, and took it upon himself to hold his new family together best as he could, seeing to his children's needs and disabilities, and gifting Marika another child to bear. He ceded the title of Elden Lord to his stepson to this end.

Godwyn, too, loved his two youngest siblings dearly. He inspired and encouraged Miquella's endeavors to spread kindness. 

The Two Fingers chose Miquella and Malenia to be Empyreans --- though whom was the Shadow of whom was unclear.

The third child she bore fared no better. By the absence of the Rune of Death, Melina was the reincarnation of her old enemy, the Gloam-Eyed Queen.

Marika now faced three threats to her power from within her own family. Marika grew fearful and kept the girl's existence and nature fiercely secret. (The return of Harita's soul re-awakened her Shadow, the God Devouring Serpent, under the Gelmir mountains, and Rykard kept it secret and placated, studying its power.)

Meanwhile Miquella rose to prominence and power through his kind nature inspiring the same loyalty in his followers as had Godwyn's honor. The boy sought out the most disenfranchised peoples in all the Lands Between, showing mercy upon them. The Omen touched by the crucible, the Misbegotten whose bloodlines were of it, the hillfolk, the albinauric lineages created with sorcery, it was rumored he even loved the Nox banished underground.

His sister, Malenia, he helped still the Rot inside her by inventing Unalloyed Gold, a metal form of his grace and mercy, which could ward off influence from without. Malenia took up the sword in her brother's defense and became the most formidable swordsmistress in the world.

Then Miquella took a sapling of the Erdtree and planted his own tree, the Haligtree. He watered it with his own blood and it grew almost as great as the Erdtree. It was beyond belief.

Twice now, had the Greater Will's messengers chosen successors to her rule. First Ranni, then Miquella. She doubted whether her actions had been in accordance with her master's wishes. Marika grew fearful.

She hatched a plan. In secret, she gave her youngest daughter the purpose of helping the Tarnished return to the Erdtree and among them rise an Elden Lord as great as Godfrey. Then she burned Melina alive, leaving her bodiless as a only a soul, a wandering spirit of ash bound to the grace of the Erdtree.

This agitated the God Devouring Serpent and with it the volcanoes of Gelmir.

## The Night of Black Knives

Ranni now made her machinations known. While Marika was thus distracted with her house being in disarray, the Lunar Princess stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh.

She had recruited Marika's own countrymen, Numen warriors into a guild of assassins, and armed them with this fragment of destined death in the form of a black knives, the most powerful of which went to their leader Alecto. The Black Knife Assasins they would come to be known as.

In one terrible night, they infiltrated Leyndell and the house of Godwyn, and put him to the blade.

But Ranni was clever in the ways of the Primeval Current and the Moon, and mastered soul magic. She had split destined death among the black blades so the assassins held only the half that destroys the soul. She kept the blade that kills the body.

While Godwyn's flesh had the cursemark of death carved into him, and his soul was forever lost, Ranni carved the counterpart into her own flesh to rid her being of the influence of the Greater Will which she so resented. Her soul found refuge in a doll she had crafted in the image of her recently diseased teacher in the arts of sorcery. Her reasons to do so are mysterious to this day --- perhaps sentiment, perhaps Ranni and her teacher were lovers.

During the escape from Leyndell, the Black Knife Assasins took many losses, in particular the daughter of the leader, Tische, sacrificed herself to save her mother.

The title of Elden Lord returned to Radagon.

## The Shattering

The loss of her most-treasured son plunged Marika into despair.

She knew then that her interpretation of the Greater Will had been lacking, and that the Golden Order was anathema --- whether she was right in this judgment is debated to this day.

Marika also knew that what she did next would cause the world to fall into disarray, so her penultimate act of aberrance was to pluck the Rune of War from the Elden Ring, and secrete it away somewhere safe.

Then she took up her hammer and shattered the Elden Ring entire.

Radagon grew fiercely angry with her. With her claim to Queendom now broken, by his authority as Elden Lord, he banished her from the Erdtree, and labored tirelessly to repair the Elden Ring --- to no avail. The Great Runes had been scattered across the land, and without their structure there was nothing to hold together the small runes.
