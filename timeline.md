# Time Immemorial

In the center of the world was the Lands Between, consisting of the lands of forested Limgrave, lakefair Liurnia, wilder Caelid, high Altus, fiery Gelmir, mountainous Norrae, and prosperous Azul.

# Era of the Greattree

The Crucible, the source of all life, begot a world tree, the Greattree.

This was a time where Dragons and Giants ruled supreme the Lands Between.

The Dragons were wise, immortal beings, protected by their impervious Gravelstone scales, ruled by Lord Placidusax, who governed from the city of Farum Azula. It was a haven to the Dragons and home to their beastman servants, with towers stretching high into the sky. The jewel of the kingdom of Azul.

The Giants were clever, hardy beings, protected by their Fell God and mastery of flame. They were ruled by a line of priests from the very highest mountains in Norrae. The mountains was a haven to the giants and home to their servants, the tribes of Zamor, and had great fortifications spanning valleys and peaks.

Knowing each other's might, the Dragons and Giants were at relative peace, with belligerence settled in duels and show battles, rather than the all-out wars both peoples knew would be utterly destructive.

In the midlands between, there were tribes and nobles who swore allegiance to one or the other and did battle as mortals do.

Of note, arose a people who mastered astrology and the magic of the cosmos. By this power they were able to repel the Giant menace, and were left to their own devices. They were known as the Nightmen and later one of their clans formed the Carian dynasty that persists to this day in Liurnia. They are said to have built grand cities and loved the night sky dearly.

Equal in mastery was a people who claimed power over the winds and the earth, speaking to the spirits within both. With such strength they kept at bay the Dragons. They were known as the Belurati and a clan of them would form the line of Storm Lords that is known of in legends.

They warred in skirmishes over generations, but never became more than honorable opponents at stalemate.

In this era also, the Greater Will started sending its messengers, the Two Fingers, to the Lands Between. A line of humble shamanesses arose to interpret the twitching language of these messengers, and were granted immotality in recompense.

# Era of the Erdtree

The Greater Will sent the Elden Beast to the Lands Between. It planted the seed of the Erdtree, and the Erdtree subsumed the Greattree. By that power, the Elden Beast established the Law of Causality and reshaped the old way of the Greattree into the Law of Regression.

Then the Elden Beast fell dormant, turning into the Elden Ring, which prescriptively encoded these laws of Causality and Regression, governing everything that happened in the Lands Between.

The Elden Beast was created to travel the cosmos and create order, not to govern the order once created. The various Two Fingers therefore started appointing Empyreans, to take up the Elden Ring and govern the Lands Between, enforcing the Greater Will's wishes in the new world.

## The Age of Iron and Pewter

The Empyreans battled for the Elden Ring so fiercely that the midlands were ravaged for an age. The giants and dragons retreated from their interests there, and yet among their servants arose those who left for the midlands, either to join the wars or as Empyreans themselves.

The Two Fingers did care not for heritage nor standing in selecting their quarries.

Among them was Marika, the Fair-Haired Queen. She held no special power but acumen and cleverness, though it is rumored she courted darker powers and outer gods when convenient, and always was she seen in the company of her firstborn son and her Shadow, the Azulan wolfman Maliketh. She united of the barbarian tribes by strength, beauty, and charisma, forming a fine fighting force. But she knew it would not be sufficient to obtain victory.

She courted then the king of the Belurati, and wed him with her army as dowry. The king, as a wedding gift, in turn taught her warriors the power over earth and wind. As thanks she slew him in his sleep on their wedding night. In an eve of terrible slaughter the city of Belurat was razed and its peoples driven from the land. By Marika's ruthless stratagems, the terrible cruelty of her firstborn, and the fury of her Shadow, she now held a fighting force with scarcely any equal.

Now at the head of an army wielding terrible power, Marika set her eyes on the only other Empyrean who stood to oppose her.

Harita, the Gloam-Eyed Queen, leader of the cult of Godslayers, wielding the red-black flame of annihilation. Little is known of her to this day, save that her Shadow was a great serpent. Her followers wore the living skins of enemies slain. And many had they slain. She had sunk cities under the earth and slain dragons and drakes. Her mere name inspired fear.

While Marika had played politics and dismantled a kingdom, Harita had hunted every other Empyrean down and put them to the needles of her grisly tailors.

That would be her downfall. Had there been a third player in the conflict, had she spared the Carian Knight-Errant Lerrana and bolstered her forces instead, she might have prevailed, for Marika's terrible attention might then have been divided.

Delving into dark powers, Marika sacrificed her own flesh and blood to the terrible fire of her ambition: she did unspeakable things to her son, fashioning him into a twisted mirror of the Gloam-Eyed Queen, endowing him with twin curses of a dread flame and a hungry serpent of his own.

The barbarians were more numerous than the skin-clad cultists, her Shadow more than a dull beast, and her son a foil to Harita's might. Hammer in hand, Marika sent the Godslayers two third to into the grave and one third fleeing for their lives.

Thus, she obtained the Elden Ring and established her rule as indisputable Queen of the Lands Between and in doing so she passed from the realm of mortality into the realm of divinity. The woman who became a goddess, the goddess who became a woman.

However, as Harita was merely defeated, not dead, she still posed a threat with her red-black flame. In spite she might harm the Erdtree, so Marika feared.

Therefore, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring, at once neutering Harita's flame and introducing the cycle of rebirth to the Lands Between, and rendering the Erdtree all but untouchable. The Rune of Death, she turned into a blade, and gave it to her Shadow.

She used this protection to wage one final persecution of the Godslayer cult, capturing Harita and putting her to the Black Blade, burning her up with her own red-black flame.

Marika, now completely unopposed, called the new state of the world the Golden Order. Her son was never seen again.

## The Age of Red Gold

Marika wed the most powerful chieftain of he war band, Hoarah Loux, and to mirror her Shadow he took the spirit lion Serosh on his back to control his bloodlust and became Godfrey the first Elden Lord. They founded the city of Leyndell around their manor at the foot of the Erdtree, and she let him command the war bands that had once been under her rule directly.

By his seed, Marika bore the Omen Twins but was revolted that the Crucible had touched her own offspring. She kept their birth secret and sent them into the tunnels under Leyndell, and decreed that all Omen children be shunned and sent below ground.

Morgott desired his mother's love despite it all and grew to understand her decision. He took it upon himself to earn it in any way he could, and remained her servant in the dark. Mogh spurned it and delved deeper underground, not to be seen again for a long time.

Marika then bore Godwyn and he grew up to be a true heir. From him began the Golden Lineage, a dynasty that was to last a thousand years. He was as great a warrior as his father, and as wise and blessed as his mother.

But he would also venture to the shunning grounds under the city to find his brother, and show him the love he had been denied. This was Godwyn's gift that set him apart from either of his parentage: his kindness and honor.

With a dynasty now established, Marika turned her gaze outwards, looking for threats to The Golden Order. The Giants of the mountains to the north had mastery over fire enough to set the Erdtree ablaze should they wish it --- Marika removed the Famine rune to let her armies march on in the unkind homelands of the Giants.

The Giants were eradicated to a man, but Godwyn spared the last of their kind. It was a hollow mercy and he knew it.

The Golden Order was then attacked by the Dragons, who saw the removal of the Runes of Death and Famine as an upset of the Natural Order --- Marika removed the Pestilence rune to let her armies fight continuously without fear of camp disease or festering wounds.

Godfrey slew the king of dragons, Gransax, but Godwyn was determined to do better this time and made peace with the dragons by sparing prince Fortissax. In the ensuing years, by the teachings of Fortissax, he founded the orders of Dragon Cultists, bolstering The Golden Order's might tenfold.

But there were those Dragons who bore misgivings of this alliance, and an accord is thought to have been struct. Faruma Azula vanished from the world, leaving behind only the Dragons who found the Order agreeable.

Having now eliminated existential threats, Marika turned her eyes on conquest. The lands of Altus were prosperous, but neighboring Liurnia grew wary of the threat posed by her rule.

Marika mustered her armies: the forces of Altus and Gelmir, the war priests of the Golden order and the Dragon Cultists, and Godfrey's war band, and marched on Liurnia. Here they were repelled again and again by the brilliance of Liurnia's strategoi, the Carian orders of spellknights, and supremely well-organized armies backed by sorcerers.

Among Marika's forces was Radagon the Red, a strong warrior who rose to the rank of general over the years of the war, eventually leading the Golden Order into the largest battle that would prove the final one. In the field, he faced the Queen Rennala of Caria, and fell in love. He ordered a retreat, and sent message to Leyndell that peace might be possible.

Marika aquiesced and Radagon was raised to the title of Prince of Gelmir and sued for peace. Rennala accepted his proposal of marriage (and subsequently fell in love with him, it was a happy union.)

## The Age of Fine Silver

With Liurnia a part of the Golden Order, there now came a period of lasting peace. Marika now had time to devote to theological studies, and in this age delved deep into the mysteries of the Elden Ring.

Absent a war, Godfrey grew restless, so Marika sent him onwards south of Liurnia and Caelid to conquer the lands there, drawing all of the Lands Between together under the Golden Order.

She let Godwyn take over rulership. He took a concubine and sired an heir named Godefroy, whom Marika declared rightful rather than bastard. Godwyn remained unwed at his mother's wish, should one day a political marriage be needed, and it is said he also enjoyed the company of Fortissax when the dragon took human form.

In Liurnia, Rennala bore Radagon three children: Rykard, Radahn, and Ranni. All three Carian heirs were prodigies of sorcery and found powerful teachers.

Radahn found a teacher in a wandering perigrine sage of Onyx and quickly mastered the sorcery of gravity. He took after his father and became a General in the Golden Order.

Rykard skirted blasphemy and revived the study of fire, through science inventing sorcerous ways to achieve feats of terrible heat. He took interest in the miracles of fire practiced in secret and gave amnesty and protection to the Fire Monks, in exchange for servitude.

Ranni took after her mother and became the Princess of Caria and a formidable sorceress in tutelage of the finest masters at Raya Lucaria. She came to be known as the Lunar Princess, taking upon her the sigil of the dark moon as her mother had taken the full.

Much to Marika's horror, word reached her from Radagon that the girl had been chosen as an Empyrean and given as Shadow the beast child Blaidd, to mirror her own Maliketh.

But Ranny was young and yet nary a threat, and Marika intended to keep her that way. The Carians derived their power from the stars and the fates they encoded --- a system beyond the reach of the Elden Ring. Where in the Age of Iron they had been summarily dealt with by Marika's enemies, now she herself had to intervene.

Before she could formulate a plan to do so, her husband returned. Godfrey was drunk on victory, and eager to take back his rightful place as Elden Lord. His warriors brought with them an unrest to the heartland that Marika found particularly displeasing: these myriad warriors were nothing but. There was no world in which they would return to Altus and find wives and husbands, settling down to till the good earth.

She lay with him one last night, and in the morning told him that he would not be taking the throne back from his son's stewardship and banished his clan and all the other tribes from the Lands Between. She tore the grace of the Erdtree from their souls, and sent them into the fog beyond the mountains and out to sea, to wander and never find there a home, and one day when the Golden Order needed them, be called back by the guidance of honeyed rays of gold.

Godwyn was dismayed to have his dear father so banished. He would never truly forgive her, but never would his love for his mother wane, either.

To now enact her plot to render her power and status as Empyrean unopposed, Marika called Radagon back to Leyndell, planning to negotiate with him regarding a possible marriage between his daughter and her son.

But upon seeing his majesty, she herself fell in love with him and seduced him.

Unbeknownst to everyone, they were but the masculine and feminine aspect of the same being. Radagon was a projection of Marika's self, a counterbalance created by Marika delving into the Law of Causality and neglecting the Law of Regression.

Radagon, wracked with guilt over his infidelity, divorced Rennala, and the peace with Liurnia was broken, but so was its Queen.

Radagon married Marika, becoming the Second Elden Lord, Godwyn offering his new stepfather the throne.

To honor her new husband, Marika raised his eldest son Rykard to Prince of Gelmir, where his mastery of fire suited well the volcanoes. He became a praetor of the inquisition, and declared blasphemous all the fire worshipping cults save his own, offering each a choice between converting to his doctrine or being thrown in the fires of Gelmir.

Radahn's loyalties were undividedly with the Golden Order. He had grown all-surpassingly powerful, a rival to Godwyn in sheer strength. The two grew close as brothers, and Marika adopted him as her own son.

Ranni remained. With her mother's heart broken, she took over rulership of Liurnia, but the Golden Order was by then so powerful that going to war would be suicide. She bore a grudge against her father and his new wife and refused Marika's overtures and offers of friendship and true peace, content to remain at a formal truce.

And here Marika now saw her opportunity to sabotage Ranni and commanded her adoptive son Radahn to use his mastery of gravitational magic to halt the very Firmament.

This cemented Ranni's resentment of her into a sworn enmity. Even Godwyn's good will and genuine desire to mend friendships did not sway he hatred. A hatred which came to include not only her father, Queen Marika, and her brothers, but also the Two Fingers, and the Greater Will they served.

The only part of her family she still loved was her mother dearest, her Shadow, and her father's pet red wolf.

## The Age of Unalloyd Gold

Marika bore Radagon twins, but because of the incestuous nature of the union and Marika's numerous crimes and imbalances, their children were born vulnerable by the caprices of fate and the balance of the Elden Ring.

By the absence of the Rune of Famine, Miquella was cursed with eternal childhood, to never grow to be a proud king like his elder brother Godwyn.

By the absence of the Rune of Pestilence, Malenia was cursed with the Scarlet Rot, to waste awa and yet regrow continuously, and spread horrific deformity and true ailment to those who touched her --- all save her brother, who was miraculously immune.

Seeing her offspring once more be afflicted twins, Marika despaired. Radagon did not, and took it upon himself to hold his new family together best as he could, seeing to his children's needs and disabilities, and gifting Marika another child to bear. He ceded the title of Elden Lord back to his stepson to this end.

Godwyn, too, loved his two youngest siblings dearly. He inspired and encouraged Miquella's endeavors to spread kindness, and saw to it that Malenia be waited on by an order of knights willing to incur the disease she bore. He even found a blind swordsman to teach her the blade, as she was herself blinded by the growths in her eyes.

This state of peace did not last.

Now the Two Fingers chose Miquella to be Empyrean --- and with his own sister as Shadow.

And if that was not horror enough, the third child Marika bore Radagon fared no better. By the absence of the Rune of Death, Melina was the reincarnation of her old enemy, the Gloam-Eyed Queen.

Marika now faced three threats to her power from within her own family. She grew fearful and kept the girl's existence and nature fiercely secret. The return of Harita's soul re-awakened her Shadow, Eiglay, the God Devouring Serpent, under the Gelmir mountains. Rykard kept it secret and placated, studying its power.

Meanwhile Miquella rose to prominence and power through his selfless and compassionate nature, inspiring soon the same fanatic loyalty in his followers as had Godwyn's honor and kindness. The boy sought out the most disenfranchised peoples in all the Lands Between, showing mercy upon them and seeing to their wounds and needs. The Omen touched by the crucible, the Misbegotten whose bloodlines were of it, the hillfolk, the albinauric lineages created with sorcery, it was rumored he even loved the people cast underground in ages past.

His sister and Shadow,  he helped still the Rot inside her by inventing Unalloyed Gold, a metal form of his grace and mercy, which could ward off influence from without. Thus bolstered Malenia took up the sword in her brother's defense and at once became the most formidable swordsmistress in the world.

Then Miquella took a sapling of the Erdtree and planted his own tree in a secret land and it was called the Haligtree. He watered it with his own blood and it grew almost as great as the Erdtree. It was beyond belief.

Twice now, had the Greater Will's messengers chosen successors to Marika rule. First Ranni, then Miquella. While she had thwarted Ranni's rise to power, she saw herself powerless to move against her second golden son. She began harboring doubts as to whether her actions had been in accordance with her master's wishes.

Marika grew fearful.

She hatched a plan. In secret, she gave her youngest daughter the purpose of helping the Tarnished return to the Erdtree and among them rise an Elden Lord as great as Godfrey. Then she burned Melina alive, leaving her bodiless as only a soul, a wandering spirit of ash bound to the grace of the Erdtree.

This agitated the God Devouring Serpent and with it the volcanoes of Gelmir. Rykard let his sister know something was afoot.

## The Night of Black Knives

Ranni now made her machinations known. While Marika was thus distracted with her house being in disarray, the Lunar Princess stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh.

She had recruited Marika's own countrymen, Numen warriors, into a guild of assassins, and armed them with this fragment of destined death in the form of black knives, the most powerful of which went to their leader Alecto. The Black Knife Assasins they would come to be known as.

In one terrible night, they infiltrated Leyndell and the house of Godwyn. It was Praetor Rykard who let them in the door, and stood guard, should Maliketh return. Godwyn was put to the blade, becoming the first of the demigods to die.

But Ranni was clever in the ways of the Primeval Current and the Moon, and mastered the matter of the soul. She had split destined death among the black blades so the assassins held only the half that destroys the soul. She kept the blade that kills the body.

While Godwyn's flesh had the cursemark of death carved into him, and his soul was forever lost, Ranni carved the counterpart into her own flesh to rid her being of the influence of the Greater Will which she so resented. Her soul found refuge in a doll she had crafted in the image of her recently diseased teacher in the arts of sorcery. Her reasons to do so are mysterious to this day --- perhaps sentiment, perhaps homage, perhaps a gesture love.

During the escape from Leyndell, Maliketh fell upon them and the traitorous Rykard did naught to hold him off now that the work was done. The Black Knife Assasins took many losses, in particular the daughter of the ringleader, Tische, sacrificed herself to save her mother.

The mantle of rulership returned to Radagon.

## The Ringbreak

The loss of her most-treasured son plunged Marika into despair. She knew then at once in her heart of hearts that her interpretation of the Greater Will had been lacking, and that the Golden Order was anathema --- whether she was right in this judgment is debated.

Marika also knew that what she did next would cause the world to fall into disarray, so her penultimate act of aberrance was to pluck the Rune of War from the Elden Ring, and secret it away somewhere safe.

Then she took up her hammer and shattered the Elden Ring entire.

Radagon grew fiercely angry with her. With her claim to Queendom now broken, by his authority as Elden Lord, he banished her from the capital, and labored tirelessly to repair the Elden Ring --- to no avail. The Great Runes had been scattered across the land, and without their structure there was nothing to hold together the small runes. For seven days and nights, he toiled with his hammer at an anvil of gold.

But no amount of soldiers and mortal lawmen can keep a God truly away. Marika retreated to her manor, plotting and planning. Then on the eighth day she returned and entered the Erdtree.

Facing Radagon, her husband and other half, her doubts, her mortality, her counterpart in every way, she hesitated. And for that, Radagon plunged his crimson spear through her breast. In return she reunited with him, the two becoming a single being, once more.

And she bode the Erdtree to swallow her.

## The Shattering War

The Great Runes fell upon the lands between, and despite Marika's precaution of hiding away the Rune of War, the land descended into caos as had never been seen since the Empyreans vyed for the Elden Ring in ages past.

None was spared the risk of coming upon a shard of the Ring and dooming themselves to misery and strife. Some came into in the hands of commoners and left entire settlements in flames as the good folk of the land fell upon one another with knife and hoe and ax.

Those already strong in the ways of battle fared better. It was soon that all of Marika's line had each obtained for themselves a great rune, oft taking from the less fortunate and paying with steel.

General Radahn the Red obtained for himself a Greatrune of Vigor, endowing him with even greater strength, will, and stamina, raising him ever closer to divine mastery of battle. Thus empowered he intended to crown himself the next Elden Lord.

He gathered his Redmane knights in Caelid and began his march upon the battlefield. He met Godefroy in the field and the King of Limgrave was slain along with three of his four sons. The craven Godrick escaped with his father's bounty and laid siege to Stormveil for a season. When the city proved unassailable, Radahn marched onwards into Liurnia.

He brokered a peace with his sister to gain passage through his homeland, though the pass of Dectus to finally enter Altus. Here he swept aside Rykard's token resistance forces and advanced directly to the heart of the Golden Order, the royal city of Leyndell.

Here the Redmanes met their match in the Leyndell forces, and as Radahn rode into battle wielding his greatbow to take down the Leyndell captainry and lead his men to victory against a disorganized enemy, he was struck down by his eldest living brother, Morgott.

Dressed not in armor but in rags, and wielding naught but a cane of iron wood and a blades of holy light, Morgott held the Greatrune of Royalty, granting him unsurpassed tenacity and the iron will to victory. Radahn lost his mettle and thus disgraced, called a full retreat, losing many men to Leyndell's cavalry.

The long march home he gave to ruminating on his status as the greatest warrior and general since Godwyn. He retreated back to his fortresses in Caelid to bolster his men and recruit anew from the hardy folk of the wild, and among the sorcerers of Selia, the sister-city of Luke. He licked his wounds and refined his skill. But his anger at his brother was not hot rage, it was humility.

Certain was he that the shunning grounds under Leyndell must be a hellish place, to produce such a formidable warrior who bore no armor nor even a blade.

It made Radahn think to the future, and he took a harem of concubines to sire a line of heirs, should he truly meet his end in battle.

## The Fall of Caelid

Miquella saw the fright wrought by his siblings and all the greed in the land. Malenia secured herself and he each a great rune of formidable power, but he knew it would never be sufficient to put an end to the slaughter and horrors.

Among the gentle Haligtree's roots he fashioned himself a cocoon of ironwood, a liminal womb of his own mother-tree's making in which he could finally undergo the metamorphosis from child to adult. His curse was a vile one, viler even than his sister's: he felt it his burden to rule gently, yet none would listen to a child king speaking a voice of authority and reason.

Where Malenia's Greatrune of Predation
