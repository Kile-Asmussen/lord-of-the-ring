# Time Immemorial

In the center of the world was the Lands Between, consisting of the lands of forested Limgrave, lakefair Liurnia, wilder Caelid, high Altus, fiery Gelmir, 

# Era of the Greattree

The Crucible, the source of all life, begot a world tree, the Greattree.

This was a time where Dragons and Giants ruled supreme the Lands Between.

The Dragons were wise, immortal beings, protected by their impervious Gravelstone scales, ruled by Lord Placidusax, who governed the southern Lands Between from his home in Farum Azula in the Caelid Wilds. Farum Azula was a haven to the Dragons and home to their beastman servants, and had towers stretching high into the sky.

The Giants were clever, hardy beings, protected by their Fell God, wielding the Flame of Ruin. They were ruled by a line of priests from the very highest mountains in the north of the Lands Between. The mountains was a haven to the giants and home to their servants, the tribes of Zamor, and had great fortifications spanning valleys and peaks.

Knowing each other's might, the Dragons and Giants were at relative peace, with belligerence settled in duels and show battles, rather than the all-out wars both peoples knew would be utterly destructive.

In the midlands, there were tribes and nobles who swore allegiance to one or the other, but of note in the lands of Liurnia arose a people who mastered astrology and the magic of the cosmos. By this power they were able to repel Giant and Dragon both, and were left to their own devices. They formed the Carian dynasty that persists to this day. 

In this era also, the Greater Will started sending its messengers, the Two Fingers, to the Lands Between. Finger readers arose to interpret their wiggles.

# Era of the Erdtree

The Greater Will sent the Elden Beast to the Lands Between. It planted the seed of the Erdtree, and the Erdtree subsumed the Greattree. By that power, the Elden Beast established the Law of Causality and reshaped the old way of the Greattree into the Law of Regression.

Then the Elden Beast fell dormant, turning into the Elden Ring, which prescriptively encoded these laws of Causality and Regression, governing everything that happened in the Lands Between.

The Elden Beast was created to travel the cosmos and create order, not to govern the order once created. The various Two Fingers therefore started appointing Empyreans, to take up the Elden Ring and govern the Lands Between, enforcing the Greater Will's wishes in the new world.

## The Age of Iron

The Two Fingers selected several Empyreans, who battled for the Elden Ring. Of them, two reached prominence:

Harita, the Gloam-Eyed Queen, leader of the cult of Godslayers, wielding the red-black flame of annihilation.

Marika, the Fair-Haired Queen, uniter of the Badlands Tribes, wielding stone and storm.

In the end, Marika obtained the Elden Ring and established her rule as Queen of the Lands Between. However, as Harita was merely defeated, not dead, she still posed a threat with her red-black flame.

Therefore, Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring, at once neutering Harita's flame and introducing the cycle of rebirth to the Lands Between. The Rune of Death, she turned into a blade, and gave it to her Shadow.

She used this protection to wage one final persecution of the Godslayer cult, capturing Harita and putting her to the Black Blade, burning her up with her own red-black flame.

Marika, now completely unopposed, called the new state of the world the Golden Order.

## The Age of Gold

Marika wed Hoarah Loux, and to mirror her Shadow he took the spirit lion Serosh on his back to control his bloodlust and became Godfrey the first Elden Lord. They founded the city of Leyndell around their manor at the foot of the Erdtree.

By his seed, Marika bore the Omen Twins but was revolted that the Crucible had touched her own offspring. She kept their birth secret and sent them into the tunnels under Leyndell, and decreed that all Omen children be shunned.

Morgott desired his mother's love despite it all and grew to understand her decision. He took it upon himself to earn it in any way he could, and remained her servant in the dark. Mogh spurned it and delved deeper underground, not to be seen again for a long time.

Marika then bore Godwyn and he grew up to be a true heir. From him began the Golden Lineage, a dynasty that was to last a thousand years. He was as great a warrior as his father, and as wise and blessed as his mother.

But he would also venture to the shunning grounds under the city to find his brother, and show him the love he had been denied. This was Godwyn's gift that set him apart from either of his parentage: his kindness.

With a dynasty now established, Marika turned her gaze outwards, looking for threats to The Golden Order. The Giants of the mountains to the north had mastery over fire that could unmake the Erdtree --- Marika removed the Famine rune to let her armies march on in the unkind homelands of the Giants.

The Giants were eradicated to a man, but Godwyn spared the last of their kind. It was a hollow mercy and he knew it.

The Golden Order was then attacked by the Dragons, who saw the removal of the Runes of Death and Famine as an upset of the Natural Order --- Marika removed the Pestilence rune to let her armies fight continuously without fear of camp disease or festering wounds.

Godfrey slew the king of dragons, Gransax, but Godwyn was determined to do better this time and made peace with the dragons by sparing prince Fortissax. In the ensuing years, by the teachings of Fortissax, he founded the orders of Dragon Cultists, bolstering The Golden Order's might tenfold.

Having now eliminated existential threats, Marika turned her eyes on conquest. The lands of Altus were prosperous, but neighboring Liurnia grew wary of the threat posed by her rule.

Marika mustered her armies: the forces of Altus and Gelmir, the war priests of the Golden order and the Dragon Cultists, and Godfrey's war band, and marched on Liurnia.

Here they were repelled again and again by the brilliance of Liurnia's strategoi, the Carian orders of spellknights, and supremely well-organized armies backed by sorcerers.

Among Marika's forces was Radagon the Red, a strong warrior who rose to the rank of general over the years of the war, eventually leading the Golden Order into the largest battle that would prove the final one.

In the field, he faced the Queen Rennala of Caria, and fell in love. He ordered a retreat, and sent message to Leyndell that peace might be possible.

Marika aquiesced and Radagon was raised to the title of Prince of Gelmir and sued for peace. Rennala accepted his proposal of marriage (and subsequently fell in love with him, it was quite a happy union.)

### Open Questions

- When is Farum Azula cast out of time?

## The Age of Silver

With Liurnia a part of the Golden Order, there now came a period of lasting peace. Marika now had time to devote to theological studies, and in this age delved deep into the mysteries of the Elden Ring.

Absent a war, Godfrey grew restless, so Marika sent him onwards south of Liurnia to conquer the lands there, drawing all of the Lands Between together under the Golden Order.

She let Godwyn take over rulership. He took a concubine and sired an heir, remaining unwed at his mother's wish, should one day a political marriage be needed. 

In Liurnia, Rennala bore Radagon three children: Rykard, Radahn, and Ranni.

All three Carian children were prodigies of sorcery and found powerful teachers. Radahn took after his father and became a General in the Golden Order, Ranni took after her mother and became the Princess of Caria. Rykard skirted blasphemy and revived the study of fire, founding the Fire Monks.

To Marika's horror, Ranni had been chosen as an Empyrean and given as Shadow the beast child Blaidd.

But the girl was young and not yet a threat, and Marika intended to keep her that way. The Carians derived their power from the stars and the fates they encoded --- a system beyond the reach of the Elden Ring. <!-- TODO -->

Before she could formulate a plan to do so, her husband returned. Godfrey was drunk on victory, and eager to take back his rightful place as Elden Lord. His warriors brought with them an unrest to the heartland that Marika found particularly displeasing: these myriad warriors were nothing but. There was no world in which they would return to Altus and find wives and husbands, settling down to till the good earth.

She lay with him one last night, and in the morning told him that he would not be taking the throne back from his son's stewardship and banished his clan and all the other tribes from the Lands Between. She tore the grace of the Erdtree from their souls, and sent them into the fog beyond the mountains and out to sea, to wander and never find there a home, and one day when the Golden Order needed them, be called back by the guidance of honeyed rays of gold.

Godwyn was dismayed to have his dear father so banished. He would never truly forgive her, but never would his love for his mother wane, either.

To now enact her plot to render her power and status as Empyrean unopposed, Marika called Radagon back to Leyndell, planning to negotiate with him regarding a possible marriage between his daughter and her son.

But upon seeing his majesty, she herself fell in love with him and seduced him.

Unbeknownst to everyone, they were but the masculine and feminine aspect of the same being. Radagon was a projection of Marika's self, a counterbalance created by Marika delving into the Law of Causality and neglecting the Law of Regression.

Radagon, wracked with guilt over his infidelity, divorced Rennala, and the peace with Liurnia was broken, but so was its Queen.

Radagon married Marika, becoming the Second Elden Lord.

To honor her new husband, Marika raised his eldest son Rykard to Prince of Gelmir, where his mastery of fire suited well the volcanoes. He became a praetor of the inquisition, and declared blasphemous all the fire worshipping cults save his own, offering each a choice between converting to his doctrine or being thrown in the fires of Gelmir.

Radahn also followed his father. He had grown all-surpassingly powerful, a rival to Godwyn in sheer strength. The two grew close as brothers, and Marika adopted him as her own son.

Ranni remained. With her mother's heart broken, she took over rulership of Liurnia, but the Golden Order was by then so powerful that going to war would be suicide. She bore a grudge against her father and his new wife and refused Marika's overtures and offers of friendship and true peace, content to remain at a formal truce.

And here Marika now saw her opportunity to sabotage Ranni and commanded her adoptive son Radahn to use his mastery of Gravitational magic to halt the Firmament.

This cemented Ranni's resentment of her into a sworn enmity. Even Godwyn's good will and genuine desire to mend friendships did not sway he hatred. A hatred which came to include not only her father, Queen Marika, and her brothers, but also the Two Fingers, and the Greater Will they served.

The only part of her family she still loved was her mother dearest, her Shadow, and her father's pet red wolf.

## The Age of Pewter

Marika bore Radagon twins, but because of the incestuous nature of the union and Marika's numerous crimes and imbalances, their children were born vulnerable by the caprices of fate and the balance of the Elden Ring.

By the absence of the Rune of Famine, Miquella was cursed with eternal childhood, to never grow to be a proud king like his eldest brother.

By the absence of the Rune of Pestilence, Malenia was cursed with the Scarlet Rot, to waste away and spread horrific deformity wherever she went. (The Greater Will might have allowed this to happen.)

Seeing her offspring once more be afflicted twins, Marika despaired. Radagon did not, and took it upon himself to hold his new family together best as he could, seeing to his children's needs and disabilities, and gifting Marika another child to bear. He ceded the title of Elden Lord to his stepson to this end.

Godwyn, too, loved his two youngest siblings dearly. He inspired and encouraged Miquella's endeavors to spread kindness. 

The Two Fingers chose Miquella and Malenia to be Empyreans --- though who was the Shadow of whom was unclear.

The third child Marika bore fared no better. By the absence of the Rune of Death, Melina was the reincarnation of her old enemy, the Gloam-Eyed Queen.

Marika now faced three threats to her power from within her own family. She grew fearful and kept the girl's existence and nature fiercely secret. The return of Harita's soul re-awakened her Shadow, Eiglay, the God Devouring Serpent, under the Gelmir mountains. Rykard kept it secret and placated, studying its power.

Meanwhile Miquella rose to prominence and power through his selfless and kind nature, inspiring the same fanatic loyalty in his followers as had Godwyn's honor. The boy sought out the most disenfranchised peoples in all the Lands Between, showing mercy upon them and seeing to their wounds and needs. The Omen touched by the crucible, the Misbegotten whose bloodlines were of it, the hillfolk, the albinauric lineages created with sorcery, it was rumored he even loved the Nox banished underground.

His sister, Malenia, he helped still the Rot inside her by inventing Unalloyed Gold, a metal form of his grace and mercy, which could ward off influence from without. Malenia took up the sword in her brother's defense and became the most formidable swordsmistress in the world.

Then Miquella took a sapling of the Erdtree and planted his own tree, the Haligtree. He watered it with his own blood and it grew almost as great as the Erdtree. It was beyond belief.

Twice now, had the Greater Will's messengers chosen successors to Marika rule. First Ranni, then Miquella. While she had thwarted Ranni's rise to power, she saw herself powerless to move against her second golden son. She began harboring doubts as to whether her actions had been in accordance with her master's wishes.

Marika grew fearful.

She hatched a plan. In secret, she gave her youngest daughter the purpose of helping the Tarnished return to the Erdtree and among them rise an Elden Lord as great as Godfrey. Then she burned Melina alive, leaving her bodiless as only a soul, a wandering spirit of ash bound to the grace of the Erdtree.

This agitated the God Devouring Serpent and with it the volcanoes of Gelmir. Rykard let his sister know something was afoot.

## The Night of Black Knives

Ranni now made her machinations known. While Marika was thus distracted with her house being in disarray, the Lunar Princess stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh.

She had recruited Marika's own countrymen, Numen warriors, into a guild of assassins, and armed them with this fragment of destined death in the form of black knives, the most powerful of which went to their leader Alecto. The Black Knife Assasins they would come to be known as.

In one terrible night, they infiltrated Leyndell and the house of Godwyn. It was Praetor Rykard who let them in the door, and stood guard, should Maliketh return. Godwyn was put to the blade, becoming the first of the demigods to die.

But Ranni was clever in the ways of the Primeval Current and the Moon, and mastered soul magic. She had split destined death among the black blades so the assassins held only the half that destroys the soul. She kept the blade that kills the body.

While Godwyn's flesh had the cursemark of death carved into him, and his soul was forever lost, Ranni carved the counterpart into her own flesh to rid her being of the influence of the Greater Will which she so resented. Her soul found refuge in a doll she had crafted in the image of her recently diseased teacher in the arts of sorcery. Her reasons to do so are mysterious to this day --- perhaps sentiment, perhaps homage, perhaps Ranni and her teacher were lovers.

During the escape from Leyndell, the Black Knife Assasins took many losses, in particular the daughter of the leader, Tische, sacrificed herself to save her mother.

The mantle of rulership returned to Radagon.

## The Shattering

The loss of her most-treasured son plunged Marika into despair.

She knew then that her interpretation of the Greater Will had been lacking, and that the Golden Order was anathema --- whether she was right in this judgment is debated.

Marika also knew that what she did next would cause the world to fall into disarray, so her penultimate act of aberrance was to pluck the Rune of War from the Elden Ring, and secrete it away somewhere safe.

Then she took up her hammer and shattered the Elden Ring entire.

Radagon grew fiercely angry with her. With her claim to Queendom now broken, by his authority as Elden Lord, he banished her from the capital, and labored tirelessly to repair the Elden Ring --- to no avail. The Great Runes had been scattered across the land, and without their structure there was nothing to hold together the small runes. For seven days and nights, he toiled with his hammer at an anvil of gold.

But no amount of soldiers and mortal lawmen can keep a God truly away. Marika retreated to her and her former husband's manor, plotting and planning. Then on the eighth day she returned and entered the Erdtree.

Facing Radagon, her husband and other half, her doubts, her mortality, her counterpart in every way, she hesitated. And for that, Radagon plunged his crimson spear through her breast. In return she reunited with him, the two becoming a single being, once more.

And she bode the Erdtree to swallow her.
